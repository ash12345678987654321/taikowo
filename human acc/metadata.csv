desc,"Disturbing videos which appear to show the killing of unarmed civilians in Northern Ethiopia by people apparently dressed in Ethiopian army uniform, have been obtained by the BBC.

In 2020 the government launched a military campaign in the region of Tigray, following an attack blamed on a rebel group, the Tigray People's Liberation Front.  

There have been accusations of serious abuses and war crimes by all sides in the conflict.

Lyrics:
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don‚Äôt want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we‚Äôre running out of time
Trying to catch the beat make up your mind
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You‚Äôre so indecisive of what I‚Äôm saying
Don‚Äôt want us to end where do I start
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
First you up and you‚Äôre down and then between

Ohh I really want to know‚Ä¶

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
But you tell me to go
Said we‚Äôre running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You‚Äôre overprotective when I‚Äôm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can‚Äôt win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won‚Äôt let this end
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you‚Äôre down and then between
Ohh I really want to know‚Ä¶
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
What do you mean?
When you don‚Äôt want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we‚Äôre running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

What is ROBLOX? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other random thing. By participating and building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúROBUX‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms. 

What is Robux
Robux is the money of Roblox, with Robux you can buy items from a huge catalog of customization items for your character. Robux can be purchased on the main Roblox site or obtained for free, as i'll explain in a moment.

The Weeknd's 'After Hours' is one of those albums that paints vivid pictures. Abel Tesfaye's music has a dark radiance that's both dreamy and eerie, and the record's videos flaunt their sensuality with a macabre grace. So we were thrilled to work with the singer and their team on three exclusive performances from the 'After Hours' song list. We're kicking off our roll-out with ""Alone Again."" Be here tomorrow and Wednesday for ""In Your Eyes"" and ""Faith.""

Thanks for watching!","It's ""Pops""! This patient has brought so much joy to me, my staff and the entire Popaholic community. We're always happy to celebrate him!
This case, though, is a teaching point for me.  No matter how old a patient gets, even if they can't walk well or can't see or hear well... they still are so appreciative if you do something as simple as extract their blackheads.. They can't do it themselves, and it really makes them feel better and look better.

His story is made truly amazing by all of you subscribers and devoted popaholics, who helped to start a gofundme account for him.  He received over $12,000 and messages of love and support from all over the WORLD, to help him to rebuild his life after he lost his dear wife.  All of this started because of blackhead extractions!?

Thank you so much for watching!!

Justin Bieber‚Äôs new 'Justice' album has arrived after a string of video releases that signaled the pop star's more spiritual and self-reflective concerns. ‚ÄúLonely‚Äù pondered the tribulations of a life spent in the spotlight. ‚ÄúHoly‚Äù magnified Justin‚Äôs personal faith, comparing it with the comfort of intimacy. Musically, that track, ‚ÄúHold On‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù hinted that R&Bieber was as strong as ever. The album ""delivers some of the strongest, most tightly controlled vocal performances of his career,‚Äù applauded one outlet. We fully agree, and we‚Äôre sure to hear more of that praise after our Official Live Performances drop. Backed by a great band and performing around color-changing glass monoliths, all secluded in a forest in the Los Angeles hills, Justin brought four songs from ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù to a higher level. Here‚Äôs ‚ÄúLonely.‚Äù

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

The outbreak has only exacerbated the challenges at malls as social distancing has placed restrictions on stores, movie theaters and restaurants. So what will become of malls in America after the pandemic ends?

Shopping malls across the U.S. have been reeling as restaurant and retail tenants struggle to keep their doors open.

Data compiled by Coresight Research shows about a quarter of U.S. malls could close over the next three to five years, accelerating a trend that began before the pandemic.

Simon Property Group ‚Äî the nation's biggest mall owner ‚Äî said earlier this month that its fourth-quarter revenue dropped by 24% on a year-over-year basis to $1.1 billion.

However, some analysts think Simon ‚Äî with its portfolio of A-rated malls and a healthy balance sheet ‚Äî will benefit as distressed malls operated by its rivals close their doors. The company is also expected to see gains from new additions like hotels and luxury residences.

""Unfortunately there are a lot of centers that don't fit that high profile and that have lost their competitive edge,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Goldfarb. ""The thing about Simon is they've been really focused on maintaining it, and that's both been through a combination of culling the lower productive centers as well as making sure that they keep investing in their top centers.""

Simon Property Group CEO David Simon said the company is also getting a lift from increasing traffic at some of its locations and from tenants paying their rent on time.

Malls are a big tax driver for the communities they serve and employ lots of people locally.¬†Watch the video above to find out more about the struggles U.S. malls face and what could become of them after the pandemic ends.

Auto-generated by YouTube.","Chelsea Cutler & Jeremy Zucker - better off. An exclusive live performance for Vevo.

It‚Äôs hard to put your finger on the elements of a chemistry that creates a truly special sound. When Chelsea Cutler and Jeremy Zucker united for a couple of  heartfelt folk-pop collabs, it got even harder. The ‚Äúcomethru‚Äù singer with a penchant for titling his tunes in lower case has a unique way with gentility. His approach is nonchalant yet refined. With the sigh-fueled ditties of last year‚Äôs ‚ÄòHow To Be Human‚Äô behind her, his partner has proven that she too is a fan of understatement. Cutler doesn‚Äôt need much more than a softly-picked guitar and a few whispered phrases to make her way into your heart. Their five-song ‚Äòbrent ii‚Äô EP is a confluence of both approachs, and each enhances the other. We invited them to our studio for performances of ‚Äúparent song‚Äù and ‚Äúbetter off.‚Äù 
With lines like ‚ÄúFriends just finished college and they‚Äôre moving to the city where I live/So you might have to see me less, but it‚Äôs always nice to have someone to miss,‚Äù they reminded us just how touching music can be.

""(US Capitol Police) is responding to the North Barricade vehicle access point along (Constitution) Avenue for reports someone rammed a vehicle into two USCP officers. A suspect is in custody. Both officers are injured. All three have been transported to the hospital,"" USCP said in a tweet Friday.
A senior congressional aide and a US Capitol Police source tell CNN that after the driver of the vehicle rammed his car into a barricade on Constitution Avenue, the driver exited the vehicle brandishing a knife. USCP responded, shooting the suspect and taking him into custody.
An email from the US Capitol Police, obtained by CNN, confirmed that sequence of events. The email stated Capitol Police officers shot the suspect after he rammed the barricade and exited holding a knife. That suspect is now in custody -- breathing and conscious -- transported to the hospital. Both officers were also injured, and one is being transported to the hospital by USCP.

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

For online interactions: Although some people may appear to be normal online, it's important to remember that there is still a large potential for danger. Please be safe while using social media sites, and make sure to refuse to meet up with adults if you are underage. If you are the appropriate age, and plan on using dating apps/websites, make sure to tell a loved one (a parent, friend, family member) your plans and whereabouts.

Enjoy these videos?  Consider sharing one or two.
Supported by viewers: http://3b1b.co/thanks‚Äã

Curious about measure theory?  This does require some background in real analysis, but if you want to dig in, here is a textbook by the always great Terence Tao.
https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/...‚Äã

Also, for the real analysis buffs among you, there was one statement I made in this video that is a rather nice puzzle.  Namely, if the probabilities for each value in a given range (of the real number line) are all non-zero, no matter how small, their sum will be infinite.  This isn't immediately obvious, given that you can have convergent sums of countable infinitely many values, but if you're up for it see if you can prove that the sum of any uncountable infinite collection of positive values must blow up to infinity.

Hi I‚Äôm Rick Shiels, welcome to my channel RickShielsPGAGolf. This YouTube channel is designed to help you play better golf, also to help you enjoy your golf more! 

I specialise in golf club reviews, golf club unboxing, golf club news, golf club head to heads, and all about golf clubs. 

I also want to make you play better golf by providing coaching video on all topics about golf, how to fix your slice, fix your hook, help you drive the golf ball longer, hit your irons more pure, hit your irons closer to the hole and help you draw and fade your golf shots. 
I will also help you lower your score by chipping better by stopping you duff and thin chips, pitch the ball closer and also create backspin. Also I will provide you help to putt better and hole more putts! 

On this channel I also make fun and entertaining golf content based on crazy and sometimes ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù golf clubs. I like to cut through the marketing hype about products and I like to give you the honest truth about golf equipment. 

If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit subscribe and also tap the notification bell so that you are always notified when I release a new video.","script free fire hack free fire dj gaming yt hack free fire ob26 free fire script free fire hack hack ff ob26 mod menu free fire free fire headshot hack how to hack free fire  #scriptfreefirescript‚Äã ff script hack free fire antenna free fire script free fire mod menu  free fire vip hack  script game guardian free fire  script para free fire  c√°ch hack free fire ob26  free fire gg script free fire script hack  ‡∏™‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏õ free fire ‡∏•‡πà‡∏≤‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏î script free fire 1.59 hack ff ob26 autoheadshot headshot hack script de free fire script antiban  hack free fire ob 26  script free fire antiban script free fire headshot  hack free fire ob26 script  script free fire atualizado  free fire new script  script free fire headshot 100  hack para free fire free fire antenna hack  free fire mod apk  free fire hack script  hack ff obb 26 free fire new hack scripts free fire,vip hack free fire headshot,hack ff ob26

Sip It Lyrics

 INTRO 
2X pussy, pussy, pussy, Pussy

 VERSE 1 
Fuck him on top.
big boob no training bra
Big boss bitch.
I could get you a new car
Fuck him in the Saint Laurent heels
he said I‚Äôm too tall
Wanna wife me up?
I go silent and say ha ha haaaa...
Uber on the wayyyy....
he said can he stay?
Don‚Äôt pull in my garageee...
Rolls Royce in driveway
I don‚Äôt got no time though
to beef on no vinyl.
I‚Äôm counting my baggies
you hoes wannabe viral
Blonde, blonde, blonde, blonde, blonde richard on my arm.
Rappers in my phone
in my DM‚Äôs won‚Äôt leave me alone.
Blonde blonde blonde blonde
hair 30 inches long
Boys on my dick
sip this pussy like its styrofoam

 HOOK 
Sip, sip, sip, sip it
Sip, sip, sip, sip it
Rappers in my phone
in my DM‚Äôs won‚Äôt leave me alone
Boys on my dick
sip this pussy like its styrofoam, yeah
Sip, sip, sip, sip it
Sip, sip, sip, sip it
Rappers in my phone
in my DM‚Äôs won‚Äôt leave me alone
Boys on my dick
sip this pussy like its styrofoam
(Post hook)
2X pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy

 VERSE 2 
Hold up, aye
Fuck her from the back
I‚Äôm a dog, Bitch I‚Äôm too raw
Tom Ford draws on my balls
bitches kiss the paws
I don‚Äôt dive in wet pussy
bitch I cannon ball
I serve these hoes
no bitch I don‚Äôt play volleyball
Let‚Äôs play a gameee...
cash or the fame.
She fuck me gooood...
She might get a chain.
I don‚Äôt got no time hoe.
let‚Äôs fuck now, I leave tomorrow
Gotta Birkin bag, hundred on the tags.
strippers popping ass
throwin‚Äô car notes
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Drop the fuckin‚Äô top
Let me do my thang,
make it rain on this fuckin‚Äô thot
This is why I‚Äôm hot
in Miami make that temper drop
Lick a lollipop
suck me dry til it‚Äôs not a drop, bitch!

At 1:06:20‚Äã, when changing r to equal 0.69*i, I said ""this is what we might think of as (2i)^x"", but that is not correct.  It's what we'd think of as [Exp(ln(2)*i)]^x for whatever complex number Exp(ln(2)*i) is.

Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with a drummer Tr√© Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.

Green Day was originally part of the late-'80s/early-'90s punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands NOFX, Sublime, the Offspring, Rancid, and Jawbreaker with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.","Archived is the new unarchived

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

edited by https://twitter.com/chipfat_‚Äã","If losing a child to an illness is one of the worst things that can happen to a family, Dr. Nadia Tremonti has made it her mission to make it better.

It‚Äôs not easy. But as a pediatric palliative care physician, she works to ensure that terminally ill children receive quality end-of-life care. Palliative care is sometimes misunderstood to shorten life expectancy, but it‚Äôs a method that increases quality of life, improves symptom burden and decreases medical costs. We follow Dr. Tremonti in John Beder's ""Dying in Your Mother's Arms"" as she works to make death less medical and more human. In the process she asks a critical question: When a child is terminally ill, how can we make the end of life a better one?
