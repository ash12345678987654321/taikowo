Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy‚Äã

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-ne...‚Äã

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/‚Äã

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning: 
https://youtu.be/i8D90DkCLhI‚Äã
https://youtu.be/bxe2T-V8XRs‚Äã

For those of you looking to go *even* deeper, check out the text ""Deep Learning"" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville.  

Also, the publication Distill is just utterly beautiful: https://distill.pub/‚Äã

Animations largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library.  https://github.com/3b1b/manim‚Äã

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

Lyrics:
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
‚ÄòCause I am capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don‚Äôt make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you‚Äôre fallin‚Äô for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‚ÄòCause once you‚Äôre mine, once you‚Äôre mine
There‚Äôs no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don‚Äôt walk away
It‚Äôs in the palm of your hand now, baby
It‚Äôs a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you‚Äôre fallin‚Äô for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‚ÄòCause once you‚Äôre mine, once you‚Äôre mine
There‚Äôs no going back

(Juicy J)
She‚Äôs a beast
I call her Karma
She‚Äôll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
‚ÄòCause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She‚Äôs sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She‚Äôll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I‚Äôm gon‚Äô put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don‚Äôt care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil‚Äô mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you‚Äôre fallin‚Äô for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‚ÄòCause once you‚Äôre mine, once you‚Äôre mine
There‚Äôs no going back

Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a ""libretto"" and their writer, as a ""librettist"". The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics (often with a variation of rhyming words) that are meant to be spoken rhythmically rather than sung","afdshsaffagk

#daylightsavingtime‚Äã #DST‚Äã #sleep‚Äã","This lipoma was out to cause trouble for my sweet patient - she had some sharp pains during surgery which was wild because a lipoma is a fat cell. Those rascal lipomas.... 

Lipomas are slow-growing, benign (non-cancerous) growths of fat cells. These cells are contained in a thin capsule that creates the appearance of a ‚Äúbump‚Äù right under the skin. Lipomas are typically not tender, move around easily, and don‚Äôt require treatment. However, some lipomas may sit in places that cause discomfort to the patient, which is why some people may request removal. Appearance is another reason people may request removal as well. Often a small incision can be made over the lipoma and they can be ""popped"" out easily, which is a simple in-office surgical procedure under local anesthesia.

This teapot comes from China, and it is a trick teapot! Inside there are two separate compartments, and depending where you place your fingers - either covering one hole or covering another hole - you can get the teapot to pour out of either internal compartment. 

Supposedly, back in the day, it was a way to get rid of an enemy, since you could pour out some tea for yourself and drink it quite safely (provided you had covered the correct hole) and you could then pour a drink for your enemy, and they would unknowingly get what was in the second compartment, maybe poison. 

Here Tim demonstrates pouring a cup of tea, and then adding milk, both from the same teapot. I suppose you could have tea or coffee, or whatever you like really.

Official music video for Katy Perry's ""Roar"" brought to you in Junglescope directed by Grady Hall & Mark Kudsi and produced by Javier Jimenez, Danny Lockwood, Patrick Nugent, Derek Johnson and Oualid Mouaness.

Lyrics:
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly
Agree politely
 
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ‚Äôcause I‚Äôve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‚ÄòCause I am a champion
And you‚Äôre gonna hear me roar
 
Louder, louder than a lion
‚ÄòCause I am a champion
And you‚Äôre gonna hear me roar
You‚Äôre gonna hear me roar
 
Now I‚Äôm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ‚Äôcause I‚Äôve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‚ÄòCause I am a champion
And you‚Äôre gonna hear me roar

It‚Äôs not easy. But as a pediatric palliative care physician, she works to ensure that terminally ill children receive quality end-of-life care. Palliative care is sometimes misunderstood to shorten life expectancy, but it‚Äôs a method that increases quality of life, improves symptom burden and decreases medical costs. We follow Dr. Tremonti in John Beder's ""Dying in Your Mother's Arms"" as she works to make death less medical and more human. In the process she asks a critical question: When a child is terminally ill, how can we make the end of life a better one?

Oh and by the way it is father‚Äôs birthday tomorrow","Justin Bieber - Anyone (Official Live Performance) | Vevo

Justin Bieber‚Äôs new 'Justice' album has arrived after a string of video releases that signaled the pop star's more spiritual and self-reflective concerns. ‚ÄúLonely‚Äù pondered the tribulations of a life spent in the spotlight. ‚ÄúHoly‚Äù magnified Justin‚Äôs personal faith, comparing it with the comfort of intimacy. Musically, that track, ‚ÄúHold On‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù hinted that R&Bieber was as strong as ever. The album ""delivers some of the strongest, most tightly controlled vocal performances of his career,‚Äù applauded one outlet. We fully agree, and we‚Äôre sure to hear more of that praise after our Official Live Performances drop. Backed by a great band and performing around color-changing glass monoliths, all secluded in a forest in the Los Angeles hills, Justin brought four songs from ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù to a higher level. Here‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnyone.‚Äù

Home page: https://www.3blue1brown.com‚Äã
Brought to you by you: http://3b1b.co/thanks‚Äã

Curious about measure theory?  This does require some background in real analysis, but if you want to dig in, here is a textbook by the always great Terence Tao.
https://terrytao.files.wordpress.com/...‚Äã

Also, for the real analysis buffs among you, there was one statement I made in this video that is a rather nice puzzle.  Namely, if the probabilities for each value in a given range (of the real number line) are all non-zero, no matter how small, their sum will be infinite.  This isn't immediately obvious, given that you can have convergent sums of countable infinitely many values, but if you're up for it see if you can prove that the sum of any uncountable infinite collection of positive values must blow up to infinity.

------------------

These animations are largely made using manim, a scrappy open source python library:  https://github.com/3b1b/manim‚Äã

If you want to check it out, I feel compelled to warn you that it's not the most well-documented tool, and it has many other quirks you might expect in a library someone wrote with only their own use in mind.

Lyrics:
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don‚Äôt want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we‚Äôre running out of time
Trying to catch the beat make up your mind
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You‚Äôre so indecisive of what I‚Äôm saying
Don‚Äôt want us to end where do I start
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
First you up and you‚Äôre down and then between

Ohh I really want to know‚Ä¶

When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
But you tell me to go
Said we‚Äôre running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You‚Äôre overprotective when I‚Äôm leaving
Trying to compromise but I can‚Äôt win
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching
You had me from the start won‚Äôt let this end
First you wanna go left and you want to turn right
Wanna argue all day make love all night
First you up and you‚Äôre down and then between
Ohh I really want to know‚Ä¶
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes
What do you mean?
When you don‚Äôt want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Said we‚Äôre running out of time
What do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?

This case, though, is a teaching point for me.  No matter how old a patient gets, even if they can't walk well or can't see or hear well... they still are so appreciative if you do something as simple as extract their blackheads.. They can't do it themselves, and it really makes them feel better and look better.

His story is made truly amazing by all of you subscribers and devoted popaholics, who helped to start a gofundme account for him.  He received over $12,000 and messages of love and support from all over the WORLD, to help him to rebuild his life after he lost his dear wife.  All of this started because of blackhead extractions!?

Thank you so much for watching!!

Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong and bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with a drummer Tr√© Cool, who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Touring guitarist Jason White became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.

Green Day was originally part of the late-'80s/early-'90s punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands NOFX, Sublime, the Offspring, Rancid, and Jawbreaker with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.","I cAn'T bELiEvE wE bRoKe ThE rEcORD!

Big boss bitch.
I could get you a new car
Fuck him in the Saint Laurent heels
he said I‚Äôm too tall
Wanna wife me up?
I go silent and say ha ha haaaa...
Uber on the wayyyy....
he said can he stay?
Don‚Äôt pull in my garageee...
Rolls Royce in driveway
I don‚Äôt got no time though
to beef on no vinyl.
I‚Äôm counting my baggies
you hoes wannabe viral
Blonde, blonde, blonde, blonde, blonde richard on my arm.
Rappers in my phone
in my DM‚Äôs won‚Äôt leave me alone.
Blonde blonde blonde blonde
hair 30 inches long
Boys on my dick
sip this pussy like its styrofoam

 HOOK 
Sip, sip, sip, sip it
Sip, sip, sip, sip it
Rappers in my phone

Boys on my dick

let‚Äôs fuck now, I leave tomorrow
Gotta Birkin bag, hundred on the tags.
strippers popping ass
throwin‚Äô car notes
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Drop the fuckin‚Äô top
Let me do my thang,
make it rain on this fuckin‚Äô thot
This is why I‚Äôm hot
in Miami make that temper drop
Lick a lollipop
suck me dry til it‚Äôs not a drop, bitch!

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

VIDEO: REUTERS","The Weeknd - Alone Again |  Vevo Official Live Performance

The Weeknd's 'After Hours' is one of those albums that paints vivid pictures. Abel Tesfaye's music has a dark radiance that's both dreamy and eerie, and the record's videos flaunt their sensuality with a macabre grace. So we were thrilled to work with the singer and their team on three exclusive performances from the 'After Hours' song list. We're kicking off our roll-out with ""Alone Again."" Be here tomorrow and Wednesday for ""In Your Eyes"" and ""Faith.""

For more Nick Jr. activities and games visit : http://www.nickjr.co.uk/‚Äã","Mary Cain‚Äôs male coaches were convinced she had to get ‚Äúthinner, and thinner, and thinner.‚Äù Then her body started breaking down. 

At 17, Mary Cain was already a record-breaking phenom: the fastest girl in a generation, and the youngest American runner to turn professional. In 2013, she was signed by the best track team in the world, Nike‚Äôs Oregon Project, run by its star coach Alberto Salazar.

Then everything collapsed. Her fall was just as spectacular as her rise, and she shares that story for the first time in the Video Op-Ed above.

Instead of becoming a symbol of girls‚Äô unlimited potential in sports, Cain became yet another standout young athlete who got beaten down by a win-at-all-costs culture. Girls like Cain become damaged goods and fade away. We rarely hear what happened to them. We move on.

The problem is so widespread it affected the only other female athlete featured in the last Nike video ad Cain appeared in, the figure skater Gracie Gold. When the ad came out in 2014, like Cain, Gold was a prodigy considered talented enough to win a gold medal at the next Olympics. And, like Cain, Gold got caught in a system where she was compelled to become thinner and thinner. She developed disordered eating to the point of imagining her own death.

‚ÄúAmerica loves a good child prodigy story, and business is ready and waiting to exploit that story, especially when it comes to girls,‚Äù said Lauren Fleshman, who ran for Nike until 2012. ‚ÄúWhen you have these kinds of good girls, girls who are good at following directions to the point of excelling, you‚Äôll find a system that‚Äôs happy to take them. And it‚Äôs rife with abuse.‚Äù

We don‚Äôt typically hear from the casualties of these systems ‚Äî the girls who tried to make their way in this system until their bodies broke down and they left the sport. It‚Äôs easy to focus on bright new stars, while forgetting about those who disappeared. We fetishize these athletes, but we don‚Äôt protect them. If they fail to pull off what we expect them to, we abandon them.

But Mary Cain‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt over. By speaking out, she‚Äôs making sure of that.

‚ÄúIn 1820, the great Northern War Chief Hongi Hika departed New Zealand for England. On his return, he brought with him the word of God and hundreds of muskets. Things would never be the same again ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Ä¶ so begins the video for Alien Weaponry‚Äôs new single, ‚ÄòKai Tangata‚Äô.

The title literally translates to ‚ÄòEat People‚Äô; and refers to the ancient MƒÅori tradition of eating the flesh of their enemies after battle in order to insult them. It is also an ancient term for a war party.

In their epic 7-minute song, the thrash metal trio recreates the memory of the early 19th Century musket wars, where Ngapuhi (Northern) tribes, newly armed with muskets, attacked and decimated the de Jong brothers‚Äô Te Arawa (Central North Island) ancestors, who at that time were still using traditional weaponry.

The driving riff that carries the song echoes the pounding footsteps of the war party, while the chorus traces the parts of the full body moko (tattoo) traditionally worn by MƒÅori warriors. The images are of brutal hand-to-hand combat and the taking of slaves, with flashes of white teeth reminding us of the eventual fate of those unfortunate captives. 

‚ÄúSome people might find it a bit grisly,‚Äù says singer and lead guitarist Lewis de Jong. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs stuff that actually happened and nobody ever talks about it. We‚Äôre not saying it‚Äôs right or wrong, it‚Äôs just a part of our history.‚Äù

The song refers to ‚Äònga tohu a T≈´matauenga‚Äô (the symbols of T≈´matauenga ‚Äì the MƒÅori god of war), and it is from this deity that the band‚Äôs debut album, T≈´, takes its name.

‚ÄúQuite a few of the songs on the album are about battles or conflict,‚Äù says drummer Henry de Jong, who was largely responsible for the lyrics of Kai Tangata. ‚ÄúSo we thought it was appropriate to name the album after T≈´matauenga. T≈´ also means to stand strong and proud, to stand for something; which we think is important as a band and as people.‚Äù

The video has special significance for the band due to the locations and people involved. Parts of the clip were filmed at the Waipu Caves, not far from where the band members live. The rest was filmed in the de Jong brothers‚Äô Te Arawa tribal territory; and many of the people featured ‚Äì including the kapa haka group Te Matarae i Orehu ‚Äì are members of their Ngati Pikiao whanau (family) and their wider Te Arawa iwi (tribe).","The math behind cryptocurrencies.

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

At first I was convinced it was a lipoma BUT it's actually a gigantic, thin wall epidermoid cyst. Stay til the end to see what's inside!

An epidermoid cyst is a non-cancerous growth commonly found on the skin of the face or neck, but can occur anywhere on the body. Just as its name suggests, these cysts occur as a result of epidermal cells, cells from the top layer of your skin a.k.a the epidermis, overgrow in a confined space. The buildup of these cells under the skin results in a ‚Äúcheesy‚Äù consistency and often a pungent odor! Epidermoid cysts are typically harmless and have no symptoms, but people often seek removal due to the appearance of the bump or because the cyst has become inflamed or ruptured. If you have a ruptured cyst you may notice, sudden redness, pain, swelling, and heat around the area, all of which can lead to an abscess forming. Surgically removing the cyst can cure the area, but the entire cyst sac and all of its contents need to be removed to ensure the cyst won‚Äôt grow back!

Well you know, nowadays, we can easily see many skyscrapers being built on the streets, and that‚Äôs why elevator is always a helpful equipment that can help us moving around, but also a place where many funny accidents could happen

In this video, all the events did happen in our life and were recorded by the security cameras, phones‚Ä¶ Some contain sorts of sensitive images but that is not the main thing that I want to focus in the video. The purpose of making this video is actually to provide entertainment information, not intending to insult any specific individuals
All the events happened in a very suitable scenario that abide to Youtube‚Äôs policies. These situations are collected from different sources on the internet (both free and paid). They are accurate, written in detailed script and commented in my own style. I also used the ‚Äúprimere‚Äù app and added music to edit these entertaining videos attracting viewers to come and watch.
I really hope that my viewers can be happy and enjoy watching my videos

What is ROBLOX? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other random thing. By participating and building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúROBUX‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms. 

What is Robux
Robux is the money of Roblox, with Robux you can buy items from a huge catalog of customization items for your character. Robux can be purchased on the main Roblox site or obtained for free, as i'll explain in a moment.

Silica gel is silicon dioxide. In the ""gel"" form its intended use is as a dessicant, that is it controls humidity by adsorbing moisture. Silicon and Oxygen bonds are very stable at physiologic temperatures, and so stable that human enzymes are unable to activate reactions. However, while it may be limited in chemical toxicity, physically it can cause problems.

These cases are patients who I, or my colleagues have seen. They are de-identified and many instances have been presented in more depth in an academic setting. These videos are not individual medical advice and are for general educational purposes only.  I do not give medical advice over the internet.

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

Justin Bieber‚Äôs new 'Justice' album has arrived after a string of video releases that signaled the pop star's more spiritual and self-reflective concerns. ‚ÄúLonely‚Äù pondered the tribulations of a life spent in the spotlight. ‚ÄúHoly‚Äù magnified Justin‚Äôs personal faith, comparing it with the comfort of intimacy.

Lyrics: Sorry ‚Äì Justin Bieber
 
You gotta go and get 
Angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies 
I hope I don't run out of Time could someone call the referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness 
 
I know you know that I 
made those mistakes maybe once or twice 
And by once or twice I Mean 
Maybe a couple a hundred times 
So let me oh let me 
Redeem oh redeem oh my self tonight 
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I‚Äôm missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
I‚Äôm sorry yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I‚Äôm sorry now
 
I'll take every single piece of the blame 
If you want me too 
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go I'll go and then 
You go you go out and spill the truth 
Can we both say the words and forget this 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I‚Äôm missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I‚Äôm missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I‚Äôm sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I‚Äôm sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry

Song by Rachid Aseyakhe","Healy - Part Of Me. An exclusive performance for Vevo DSCVR, the channel for the best in new music. 

Healy raps and sings. He pens poetic lyrics. But most of all, Healy sets a mood. The Memphis native‚Äôs spin on alt-R&B has drawn listeners into his emotional landscape since the arrival of 2017‚Äôs ‚ÄòSubluxe,' a debut that arrived with a vibe that‚Äôs chill, self-reflective, and a little bit melancholy. Pretty impressive for a guy who was working on a doctorate in physical therapy at the University of Tennessee at the time. Its success pushed Healy to choose healing with music over healing in a clinic, and move to Los Angeles. Finding footing in a new city for a new career can be overwhelming. But Healy was inspired by SoCal, and his brand of introspective songwriting thrived. That‚Äôs why much of ‚ÄòTungsten,‚Äô feels like a kaleidoscope of trepidatious moments. Over an ethereal beat, ‚ÄúNikes On,‚Äù his sophomore album's breakout single, contemplates how fast time flies - almost like it‚Äôs wearing track shoes. ‚ÄúI like to let life and nature leave their inflections on music,‚Äù he‚Äôs said. ‚ÄúAnd I really go with my gut.‚Äù We‚Äôre happy we went with our gut by choosing Healy to join our DSCVR ranks. These takes of ‚ÄúNikes On‚Äù and ""Part Of Me‚Äù put his skills on display, and we‚Äôre confident you‚Äôre gonna like what you hear here.

George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Twitter: https://twitter.com/gavinlowther‚Äã","This week we continue with ‚ÄúA Moment in Mexico,‚Äù our special series of six Op-Docs by Mexican directors. The second film in the series is Everardo Gonz√°lez‚Äôs haunting ‚ÄúChildren of the Narco Zone,‚Äù which is a companion piece to his stunning feature documentary, ‚ÄúLa Libertad del Diablo‚Äù (or ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Freedom‚Äù).

In both films, Gonz√°lez explores the personal toll of organized crime and the drug war through searing interviews with people with direct experience either of violence or its social ramifications. In ‚ÄúChildren of the Narco Zone,‚Äù the focus is specifically on how a climate of violence affects children and shapes their understanding of what‚Äôs right and wrong. As in ‚ÄúLa Libertad del Diablo,‚Äù Gonz√°lez dresses all his subjects in masks ‚Äî partly to give them anonymity, and partly as an eerie aesthetic choice. But the result is a mosaic of deeply individual testimonies.

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

It‚Äôs hard to put your finger on the elements of a chemistry that creates a truly special sound. When Chelsea Cutler and Jeremy Zucker united for a couple of  heartfelt folk-pop collabs, it got even harder. The ‚Äúcomethru‚Äù singer with a penchant for titling his tunes in lower case has a unique way with gentility. His approach is nonchalant yet refined. With the sigh-fueled ditties of last year‚Äôs ‚ÄòHow To Be Human‚Äô behind her, his partner has proven that she too is a fan of understatement. Cutler doesn‚Äôt need much more than a softly-picked guitar and a few whispered phrases to make her way into your heart. Their five-song ‚Äòbrent ii‚Äô EP is a confluence of both approachs, and each enhances the other. We invited them to our studio for performances of ‚Äúparent song‚Äù and ‚Äúbetter off.‚Äù 
With lines like ‚ÄúFriends just finished college and they‚Äôre moving to the city where I live/So you might have to see me less, but it‚Äôs always nice to have someone to miss,‚Äù they reminded us just how touching music can be.
