Silica gel is silicon dioxide. In the ""gel"" form its intended use is as a dessicant, that is it controls humidity by adsorbing moisture. Silicon and Oxygen bonds are very stable at physiologic temperatures, and so stable that human enzymes are unable to activate reactions. However, while it may be limited in chemical toxicity, physically it can cause problems.

Welcome to the Gus Johnson channel, where the most average content comes to fizzle out.

Thanks for watching and sharing! Don't stab people. I'll see you later.","10 MOMENTS WHEN FOOTBALL FANS GO TOO FAR

football is probably the most competitive sport ever invented, the fans are relentless and more hardcore than any sports even the players can be overly competitive at times with a lot of players being known to cheat like this goalkeeper who digs up the penalty spot making the penalty taker miss     But the fans can be even more relentless running onto the field releasing fireworks onto the field and much worse, you should never do this if you go to a football game today we‚Äôre going through 15 moments when football fans go too far

This first fan was betting with his friend whether or not he could hit this footballer on the head with a water bottle and whether it would reach or not and it turns out it did, dele ali was going to take a throw in but before he does he gets knocked on the head with a  water bottle from the stands before he taunts the fans with  2 nil hand sign because his team is 2 goals up

This next moment shows a fan who runs all the way down from the stands and onto the football field only to kick the ball out of a player hands, this player goes to take a throw in but this fan interrupts that and kicks the ball away from him, this almost turns into a small scuffle till the security interrupt 

This next fan was famous for rushing onto the pitch during the Champions League final, this fan for publicity runs onto the field and is quickly apprehended but this actually lead to her gaining over 1 million followers the same night for this publicity stunt and also because she‚Äôs beautiful

This next moment shows when fans go way too over the top by bringing in fireworks and firecrackers and throwing them on the pitch destroying the pitch and stopping the game indefinitely, this has happened so many times though that there‚Äôs compilations of fireworks being released onto pitches

This next moment showcases when cardiff city fans raid the pitch, this was literally seconds after the players had gone through the tunnel and it took hours to get all the fans off the pitch even the person recording this has had enough of everyone

This next fan with a  motorised wheelchair rushes onto the pitch with his arm in the air in celebration he is then high fived by another fan who made it onto the pitch

This next fan actually ends up taking the free kick at game while he‚Äôs being chased by security, the players are unaware of the player invading the pitch until they notice the ball going towards the goal, the goalie is aware though and actually saves the ball from going in with ease, he was then apprehended shortly after

This next fan actually approaches football legend luis suarez when he played for liverpool he harrases suarez until he actually gets down onto his knees and worships him he then stands back up and taunts towards the cameras which they would‚Äôve offended hundreds of thousands of people watching at home

9: this next football fans actually tries to climb over the fence at this football game something that a lot of football fans do which is dangerous but this one was caught on camera and the guy completely fails and ends up falling back making himself look foolish in the process even though he does nearly make it

This next fan parachutes onto the pitch obviously for publicity you can tell by his parachute and his lack of surprise when he sees where he is, this caused the whole game to stop and restart as this fan quickly gets off the pitch when he sees how annoyed the players are at this interruption

This isn‚Äôt the only time this has happened though in this boxing match for publicity a fan used a motorised parachute to glide into the stands interrupting the match and risking a lot of peoples safety luckily no one was injured

11 this next group of fans strangely decided to throw beach balls onto the stadium which is obviously very strange and i have no idea how they managed to sneak this many beach balls into the stadium without security noticing but they did and they interrupted this game as they had to all be collected

12: this next moment shows when neymar jr one of the best wingers in football was being touched and harassed by a fan in the stands as he took an alternative route to get out of the stadium neymar being neymar obviously retaliated 

13: this next player actually takes this penalty, this russian team is in a tense spot this penalty could be the difference between winning and drawing but this fan interrupts the penalty and takes it himself before running off while being chased by security

14: this next fan actually does something very weird and unusual this ahs never been done before this and has never been attempted after but this fan decides to throw money on the pitch to try to distract players, this doesn‚Äôt work, probably because it was only a stack of one dollar bills but still it‚Äôs very weird

15: these next fans throw weird items onto the pitch including baby dolls and toy pigs some of these are in","Cyrus dressed up as a Fortnite character. So cool!

#daylightsavingtime‚Äã #DST‚Äã #sleep‚Äã","This lipoma was out to cause trouble for my sweet patient - she had some sharp pains during surgery which was wild because a lipoma is a fat cell. Those rascal lipomas.... 

Lipomas are slow-growing, benign (non-cancerous) growths of fat cells. These cells are contained in a thin capsule that creates the appearance of a ‚Äúbump‚Äù right under the skin. Lipomas are typically not tender, move around easily, and don‚Äôt require treatment. However, some lipomas may sit in places that cause discomfort to the patient, which is why some people may request removal. Appearance is another reason people may request removal as well. Often a small incision can be made over the lipoma and they can be ""popped"" out easily, which is a simple in-office surgical procedure under local anesthesia.

BGM: Calix
https://twitter.com/calixphil‚Äã","Mary Cain‚Äôs male coaches were convinced she had to get ‚Äúthinner, and thinner, and thinner.‚Äù Then her body started breaking down. 

At 17, Mary Cain was already a record-breaking phenom: the fastest girl in a generation, and the youngest American runner to turn professional. In 2013, she was signed by the best track team in the world, Nike‚Äôs Oregon Project, run by its star coach Alberto Salazar.

Then everything collapsed. Her fall was just as spectacular as her rise, and she shares that story for the first time in the Video Op-Ed above.

Instead of becoming a symbol of girls‚Äô unlimited potential in sports, Cain became yet another standout young athlete who got beaten down by a win-at-all-costs culture. Girls like Cain become damaged goods and fade away. We rarely hear what happened to them. We move on.

The problem is so widespread it affected the only other female athlete featured in the last Nike video ad Cain appeared in, the figure skater Gracie Gold. When the ad came out in 2014, like Cain, Gold was a prodigy considered talented enough to win a gold medal at the next Olympics. And, like Cain, Gold got caught in a system where she was compelled to become thinner and thinner. She developed disordered eating to the point of imagining her own death.

‚ÄúAmerica loves a good child prodigy story, and business is ready and waiting to exploit that story, especially when it comes to girls,‚Äù said Lauren Fleshman, who ran for Nike until 2012. ‚ÄúWhen you have these kinds of good girls, girls who are good at following directions to the point of excelling, you‚Äôll find a system that‚Äôs happy to take them. And it‚Äôs rife with abuse.‚Äù

We don‚Äôt typically hear from the casualties of these systems ‚Äî the girls who tried to make their way in this system until their bodies broke down and they left the sport. It‚Äôs easy to focus on bright new stars, while forgetting about those who disappeared. We fetishize these athletes, but we don‚Äôt protect them. If they fail to pull off what we expect them to, we abandon them.

But Mary Cain‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt over. By speaking out, she‚Äôs making sure of that.

Justin Bieber‚Äôs new 'Justice' album has arrived after a string of video releases that signaled the pop star's more spiritual and self-reflective concerns. ‚ÄúLonely‚Äù pondered the tribulations of a life spent in the spotlight. ‚ÄúHoly‚Äù magnified Justin‚Äôs personal faith, comparing it with the comfort of intimacy. Musically, that track, ‚ÄúHold On‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù hinted that R&Bieber was as strong as ever. The album ""delivers some of the strongest, most tightly controlled vocal performances of his career,‚Äù applauded one outlet. We fully agree, and we‚Äôre sure to hear more of that praise after our Official Live Performances drop. Backed by a great band and performing around color-changing glass monoliths, all secluded in a forest in the Los Angeles hills, Justin brought four songs from ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù to a higher level. Here‚Äôs ‚ÄúHoly.‚Äù

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

Official music video for Katy Perry's ""Roar"" brought to you in Junglescope directed by Grady Hall & Mark Kudsi and produced by Javier Jimenez, Danny Lockwood, Patrick Nugent, Derek Johnson and Oualid Mouaness.

Lyrics:
I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
So I sit quietly
Agree politely
 
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing
So I fell for everything
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ‚Äôcause I‚Äôve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‚ÄòCause I am a champion
And you‚Äôre gonna hear me roar
 
Louder, louder than a lion
‚ÄòCause I am a champion
And you‚Äôre gonna hear me roar
You‚Äôre gonna hear me roar
 
Now I‚Äôm floating like a butterfly
Stinging like a bee, I earned my stripes
I went from zero
To my own hero
 
(Pre-Chorus)
You held me down but I got up
Already brushing off the dust
You hear my voice, you hear that sound
Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
 
You held me down but I got up
Get ready ‚Äôcause I‚Äôve had enough
I see it all, I see it now
 
(Chorus)
I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
Dancing through the fire
‚ÄòCause I am a champion
And you‚Äôre gonna hear me roar

WE HAD TO EAT IT ALL! (10,000 SUSHI ROLLS)
https://youtu.be/-c68S4B4fdc‚Äã","Justin Bieber - Anyone (Official Live Performance) | Vevo

Justin Bieber‚Äôs new 'Justice' album has arrived after a string of video releases that signaled the pop star's more spiritual and self-reflective concerns. ‚ÄúLonely‚Äù pondered the tribulations of a life spent in the spotlight. ‚ÄúHoly‚Äù magnified Justin‚Äôs personal faith, comparing it with the comfort of intimacy. Musically, that track, ‚ÄúHold On‚Äù and ‚ÄúPeaches‚Äù hinted that R&Bieber was as strong as ever. The album ""delivers some of the strongest, most tightly controlled vocal performances of his career,‚Äù applauded one outlet. We fully agree, and we‚Äôre sure to hear more of that praise after our Official Live Performances drop. Backed by a great band and performing around color-changing glass monoliths, all secluded in a forest in the Los Angeles hills, Justin brought four songs from ‚ÄúJustice‚Äù to a higher level. Here‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnyone.‚Äù

The second film in the series is Everardo Gonz√°lez‚Äôs haunting ‚ÄúChildren of the Narco Zone,‚Äù which is a companion piece to his stunning feature documentary, ‚ÄúLa Libertad del Diablo‚Äù (or ‚ÄúDevil‚Äôs Freedom‚Äù).

In both films, Gonz√°lez explores the personal toll of organized crime and the drug war through searing interviews with people with direct experience either of violence or its social ramifications. In ‚ÄúChildren of the Narco Zone,‚Äù the focus is specifically on how a climate of violence affects children and shapes their understanding of what‚Äôs right and wrong. As in ‚ÄúLa Libertad del Diablo,‚Äù Gonz√°lez dresses all his subjects in masks ‚Äî partly to give them anonymity, and partly as an eerie aesthetic choice. But the result is a mosaic of deeply individual testimonies.

This teapot comes from China, and it is a trick teapot! Inside there are two separate compartments, and depending where you place your fingers - either covering one hole or covering another hole - you can get the teapot to pour out of either internal compartment. 

Supposedly, back in the day, it was a way to get rid of an enemy, since you could pour out some tea for yourself and drink it quite safely (provided you had covered the correct hole) and you could then pour a drink for your enemy, and they would unknowingly get what was in the second compartment, maybe poison. 

Here Tim demonstrates pouring a cup of tea, and then adding milk, both from the same teapot. I suppose you could have tea or coffee, or whatever you like really.

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

I‚Äôm Quisha, the one who always brings the funniest and most interesting things to you
Well you know, nowadays, we can easily see many skyscrapers being built on the streets, and that‚Äôs why elevator is always a helpful equipment that can help us moving around, but also a place where many funny accidents could happen
Some of them maybe coincidental, but some are real jokes, however, they were all recorded by the camera and attract lots of viewers to come and watch
Now, let‚Äôs come with
20 embarrassing & funny elevator moments caught on camera
In this video, all the events did happen in our life and were recorded by the security cameras, phones‚Ä¶ Some contain sorts of sensitive images but that is not the main thing that I want to focus in the video. The purpose of making this video is actually to provide entertainment information, not intending to insult any specific individuals
All the events happened in a very suitable scenario that abide to Youtube‚Äôs policies. These situations are collected from different sources on the internet (both free and paid). They are accurate, written in detailed script and commented in my own style. I also used the ‚Äúprimere‚Äù app and added music to edit these entertaining videos attracting viewers to come and watch.
I really hope that my viewers can be happy and enjoy watching my videos

This film depicts some of those who have made fortunes amid the chaos, including musicians, mining bosses, entrepreneurs and preachers.

The DRC is rich in raw materials, but only a few profit from its natural resources. While 60% of Congo's inhabitants live on less than $1.25 per day, businessmen, artists, former rebel leaders and evangelists are reaping the rewards of economic growth. In the capital, Kinshasa, these new rich live in safe and luxurious enclaves, while children toil in coltan mines in the eastern part of the country.
Fally Ipupa has made his money with music. Others rely on their business acumen, like Patricia Nzolantima, who founded a taxi company and aims to give more opportunities to women.
With 3,000 mine workers, Cooperamma is the largest employer in North Kivu, in the east of the DRC. Managing director Robert Seninga says his coltan mines are extremely well-run, yet safety standards are poor. Coltan, a globally coveted mineral, is used in cell phones and other devices. It‚Äôs both a blessing and a curse for the Congo. It makes some rich, but for others it means death. The region still suffers from ethnic and factional conflicts, with money from illegal coltan smuggling financing new violence. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle.

‚ÄúIn 1820, the great Northern War Chief Hongi Hika departed New Zealand for England. On his return, he brought with him the word of God and hundreds of muskets. Things would never be the same again ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚Ä¶ so begins the video for Alien Weaponry‚Äôs new single, ‚ÄòKai Tangata‚Äô.

The title literally translates to ‚ÄòEat People‚Äô; and refers to the ancient MƒÅori tradition of eating the flesh of their enemies after battle in order to insult them. It is also an ancient term for a war party.

In their epic 7-minute song, the thrash metal trio recreates the memory of the early 19th Century musket wars, where Ngapuhi (Northern) tribes, newly armed with muskets, attacked and decimated the de Jong brothers‚Äô Te Arawa (Central North Island) ancestors, who at that time were still using traditional weaponry.

The driving riff that carries the song echoes the pounding footsteps of the war party, while the chorus traces the parts of the full body moko (tattoo) traditionally worn by MƒÅori warriors. The images are of brutal hand-to-hand combat and the taking of slaves, with flashes of white teeth reminding us of the eventual fate of those unfortunate captives. 

‚ÄúSome people might find it a bit grisly,‚Äù says singer and lead guitarist Lewis de Jong. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs stuff that actually happened and nobody ever talks about it. We‚Äôre not saying it‚Äôs right or wrong, it‚Äôs just a part of our history.‚Äù

The song refers to ‚Äònga tohu a T≈´matauenga‚Äô (the symbols of T≈´matauenga ‚Äì the MƒÅori god of war), and it is from this deity that the band‚Äôs debut album, T≈´, takes its name.

‚ÄúQuite a few of the songs on the album are about battles or conflict,‚Äù says drummer Henry de Jong, who was largely responsible for the lyrics of Kai Tangata. ‚ÄúSo we thought it was appropriate to name the album after T≈´matauenga. T≈´ also means to stand strong and proud, to stand for something; which we think is important as a band and as people.‚Äù

The video has special significance for the band due to the locations and people involved. Parts of the clip were filmed at the Waipu Caves, not far from where the band members live. The rest was filmed in the de Jong brothers‚Äô Te Arawa tribal territory; and many of the people featured ‚Äì including the kapa haka group Te Matarae i Orehu ‚Äì are members of their Ngati Pikiao whanau (family) and their wider Te Arawa iwi (tribe).","It's morning somewhere in the world = w=

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy‚Äã

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!
https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-ne...‚Äã

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/‚Äã

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning:

Meet Peppa Pig and her family:

Peppa Pig
Peppa Pig is a lovable but slightly bossy little pig. She is four years old and lives with Mummy Pig, Daddy Pig and her little brother George. Peppa likes playing with her best friend Suzy Sheep, visiting Granny and Grandpa Pig and looking after George. Most of all, Peppa loves jumping up and down in muddy puddles, laughing and making loud snorting noises.

George Pig
George is Peppa‚Äôs little brother. He is 18 months old and loves to play with his big sister, Peppa ‚Äì even when she‚Äôs being bossy. George‚Äôs favourite thing is his toy dinosaur. He carries it everywhere with him. George can‚Äôt speak yet but can say one word very well: ‚ÄòDine-saw!‚Äô

Mummy Pig
Mummy Pig likes jumping up and down in muddy puddles almost as much as Peppa. She works from home on her computer and sometimes lets Peppa and George help, as long as they don‚Äôt bash the keyboard. She is better at map reading than Daddy Pig and is very wise about most things.

Daddy Pig
Daddy Pig is very jolly and laughs all the time, especially when he plays with Peppa and George. Daddy Pig reads the paper and gets excited about trips in the car. He loves cookies and pumpkin pie and Peppa teases him about his big round tummy. Daddy Pig can be a tiny bit grumpy sometimes when he can‚Äôt remember where he put his glasses.

Have fun with Peppa Pig and her friends: Suzy Sheep,Rebecca Rabbit,Danny Dog,Candy Cat,Pedro Pony,Zoe Zebra,Emily Elephant,Freddy Fox,Kylie Kangaroo,Wendy Wolf,Gabriella Goat,Gerald Giraffe,Molly Mole,Belinda Bear,Delphine Donkey, Peggi and Pandora Panda,Mandy Mouse,Simon Squirrel!

At first I was convinced it was a lipoma BUT it's actually a gigantic, thin wall epidermoid cyst. Stay til the end to see what's inside!

An epidermoid cyst is a non-cancerous growth commonly found on the skin of the face or neck, but can occur anywhere on the body. Just as its name suggests, these cysts occur as a result of epidermal cells, cells from the top layer of your skin a.k.a the epidermis, overgrow in a confined space. The buildup of these cells under the skin results in a ‚Äúcheesy‚Äù consistency and often a pungent odor! Epidermoid cysts are typically harmless and have no symptoms, but people often seek removal due to the appearance of the bump or because the cyst has become inflamed or ruptured. If you have a ruptured cyst you may notice, sudden redness, pain, swelling, and heat around the area, all of which can lead to an abscess forming. Surgically removing the cyst can cure the area, but the entire cyst sac and all of its contents need to be removed to ensure the cyst won‚Äôt grow back!

EMP: http://emp.me/RGH‚Äã

After the successful release of Sacrificium (2014) and their intensive tour with over 150 shows, that took them around the globe, it‚Äôs time to release a new inspiring dimension in the world of Xandria: Please welcome Theater Of Dimensions!

‚ÄúWe brought back plenty of memories, sometimes just bits and pieces, but those stuck to our heads. And it made us see who we are and where we wanted to take our music. All this makes the most colourful Xandria album so far. It contains our most heavy and most emotional moments.‚Äù A confident statement by a band that knows it`s ready for a big, big step! German Epic Symphonic Metal stalwarts Xandria found stability with singer Dianne van Giersbergen and now take things to the next level with their seventh studio album, once more produced in loving detail by Joost van den Broek. Theater of Dimensions is a hyper-emotional affair ‚Äì and a very heavy one too, naturally. High class guest vocals can be heard by mighty Henning Basse (Firewind), Zaher Zorgati (Myrath), Bj√∂rn Strid (Soilwork) and Ross Thompson (Van Canto). There is a soundtrack-like, orchestral finesse inherent to the compositions, echoed by pounding groove and sophisticated shredding. Folklore and ballad chime in (‚ÄòForsaken love‚Äò), heavy thrash rears its ugly head (‚ÄòWe are murderers (we all)‚Äò), and overall there is no doubt: Xandria are not only fearless, they are at their most entertaining and thrilling!

 

A highly emotional affair ‚Äì and a very heavy one as well!
Fearless, colorful and more exciting than ever before - Pure Symphonic Metal at its very best!","KOMO Anchor Eric Johnson takes an in-depth look at the impact the drug and homelessness problem is having on our city and possible solutions in ""Seattle is Dying,"" a news documentary that aired on KOMO-TV in March, 2019.

Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a ""libretto"" and their writer, as a ""librettist"". The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics (often with a variation of rhyming words) that are meant to be spoken rhythmically rather than sung","‚òÖTwitter: https://twitter.com/ninomaeinanis‚Äã

Healy raps and sings. He pens poetic lyrics. But most of all, Healy sets a mood. The Memphis native‚Äôs spin on alt-R&B has drawn listeners into his emotional landscape since the arrival of 2017‚Äôs ‚ÄòSubluxe,' a debut that arrived with a vibe that‚Äôs chill, self-reflective, and a little bit melancholy. Pretty impressive for a guy who was working on a doctorate in physical therapy at the University of Tennessee at the time. Its success pushed Healy to choose healing with music over healing in a clinic, and move to Los Angeles. Finding footing in a new city for a new career can be overwhelming. But Healy was inspired by SoCal, and his brand of introspective songwriting thrived. That‚Äôs why much of ‚ÄòTungsten,‚Äô feels like a kaleidoscope of trepidatious moments. Over an ethereal beat, ‚ÄúNikes On,‚Äù his sophomore album's breakout single, contemplates how fast time flies - almost like it‚Äôs wearing track shoes. ‚ÄúI like to let life and nature leave their inflections on music,‚Äù he‚Äôs said. ‚ÄúAnd I really go with my gut.‚Äù We‚Äôre happy we went with our gut by choosing Healy to join our DSCVR ranks. These takes of ‚ÄúNikes On‚Äù and ""Part Of Me‚Äù put his skills on display, and we‚Äôre confident you‚Äôre gonna like what you hear here.

Lyrics:
I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
‚ÄòCause I am capable of anything
Of anything and everything
Make me your Aphrodite
Make me your one and only
But don‚Äôt make me your enemy
Your enemy, your enemy

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you‚Äôre fallin‚Äô for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‚ÄòCause once you‚Äôre mine, once you‚Äôre mine
There‚Äôs no going back

Mark my words
This love will make you levitate
Like a bird
Like a bird without a cage
But down to earth
If you choose to walk away
Don‚Äôt walk away
It‚Äôs in the palm of your hand now, baby
It‚Äôs a yes or a no, no maybe
So just be sure
Before you give it all to me
All to me
Give it all to me

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you‚Äôre fallin‚Äô for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‚ÄòCause once you‚Äôre mine, once you‚Äôre mine
There‚Äôs no going back

(Juicy J)
She‚Äôs a beast
I call her Karma
She‚Äôll eat your heart out
Like Jeffrey Dahmer

Be careful
Try not to lead her on
Shorty heart is on steroids
‚ÄòCause her love is so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her
If you get the chance, you better keep her
She‚Äôs sweet as pie, but if you break her heart
She‚Äôll turn cold as a freezer

That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I‚Äôm gon‚Äô put her in a coma

Now I think I love her
Shorty so bad, sprung and I don‚Äôt care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turned the bedroom into a fair

Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil‚Äô mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

(Pre-Chorus)
So you wanna play with magic
Boy, you should know what you‚Äôre fallin‚Äô for
Baby, do you dare to do this
‚ÄòCause I‚Äôm coming atcha like a dark horse

(Chorus)
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm
‚ÄòCause once you‚Äôre mine, once you‚Äôre mine
There‚Äôs no going back

PS MESSAGE FROM PROF MORIARTY: ""I misspoke for the last sentence of the video. What I meant to say is that the photons don't have enough energy to excite electrons across the energy gap and therefore light is transmitted. What I said was precisely the opposite, contradicting everything else in the video. Apologies for any confusion caused.""

Lyrics: Sorry ‚Äì Justin Bieber
 
You gotta go and get 
Angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies 
I hope I don't run out of Time could someone call the referee
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness 
 
I know you know that I 
made those mistakes maybe once or twice 
And by once or twice I Mean 
Maybe a couple a hundred times 
So let me oh let me 
Redeem oh redeem oh my self tonight 
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I‚Äôm missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
I‚Äôm sorry yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I‚Äôm sorry now
 
I'll take every single piece of the blame 
If you want me too 
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go I'll go and then 
You go you go out and spill the truth 
Can we both say the words and forget this 
 
Yeah
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Cause I‚Äôm missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I‚Äôm missing more than just your body 
Is it too late now to say sorry 
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I‚Äôm sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now 
 
I‚Äôm sorry (yeah)
Sorry (oh)
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down 
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now
