The FBI office has received an alarming phone call - Twitter has been hacked, and it’s more serious than any digital hack that the cybersecurity department has ever seen before. 

With a handful of clues, we’ll need your help to solve the puzzle and bring these no-good black-hat hackers to justice. Let's figure this out together, before the list of victims supasses its tipping point and turns this into a national emergency, and before billions of dollars are stolen.

So heavily, in fact, that many of the stories and characters were lifted directly from Greek plays. This time around, you'll learn about Plautus, Terence, and Seneca, and just what they owe to Menander.

--

Every time you breathe, air travels down the trachea, through a series of channels, and then reaches little clusters of air sacs in the lungs. These tiny sacs facilitate a crucial exchange: allowing oxygen from the air we breathe into the bloodstream and clearing out carbon dioxide. Pneumonia wreaks havoc on this exchange system. Eve Gaus and Vanessa Ruiz detail how pneumonia attacks the lungs.

Lesson by Eve Gaus and Vanessa Ruiz, directed by Artrake Studio.

I hope I've articulated everything clearly in this video. If not, I'll clarify in comments. Thanks to everyone who appears in this video and thanks to everyone who watches this video!

Veritasium is of course a combination of the latin 'veritas' meaning truth, and the common element ending 'ium'. I guess this is my version of the 'draw my life' craze that rolled through YouTube many years ago. Except I wanted to tell my story with the actual moments, the photons, the stored magnetic states. There's something about that which is so important to me (because I think the alternative involves fooling yourself) which is why I'm so fascinated by film and video.

One of my inspirations for the name Veritasium came from the end of the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats, in which he writes:
 ""Beauty is truth, truth beauty,—that is all
                Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.""

Is there a right way to play Monopoly?

Brian Valentine takes a stab at the answer — he was the United States representative to the 2015 World Monopoly championships, where he earned a third-place finish. As the above video shows, playing Monopoly right involves learning the rules all over again, processing key strategies, and, above all, valuing the people you play it with.

Valentine shares his knowledge about probability heat maps that show the likelihood of landing on a certain space, nuances of gameplay around houses and hotels, and even a few tips on making games fun instead of rancorous.

Further reading
There are tons of articles that break down the math of Monopoly. While it’s not the only ingredient to playing Monopoly right, it’s an important one. This Business Insider article by Walt Hickey is a great primer, and this Thrillist article by Daisy Barringer gives you even more tips.

If you really want to go deep on Monopoly championships, check out the Fandom history, including Valentine’s appearance in 2015.

Most top Monopoly players follow in the footsteps of Philip Orbanes, who’s written a few Monopoly books, including this guide. His general board game history book, The Game Makers, is a fun read (but not really about gameplay strategy).

In a ProPublica feature that collected the stories of over 1,400 former IBM employees, it was estimated that a staggering 20,000 American employees ages 40 and over have been eliminated by the company. How does one of the country’s largest tech giants quietly push out this many older workers? Don’t we have laws to protect people at the end of their careers?

Vlog Channel: https://goo.gl/7SzkmZ​","Hollywood has come a long way since Adam West's Batman was the standard-bearer of superhero smackdown-ery. Now the only thing holding good guys and bad guys back is the imagination of the people behind the camera. But no matter how many cities Superman demolishes, no matter how many moons Thanos tosses, one thing that remains fairly consistent is how these action sequences fit into the structure of their respective films, pushing the narrative along and looking damn good while they do it.

As Super Movie Madness continues here at IGN, where you the IGN audience can vote to help determine the best superhero movie ever, we're going to break down how these action scenes, large and small, fit into the superhero stories these movies celebrate. Every superhero movie isn't created equal, so some movies may handle their spectacle a little differently, but when you're a studio pumping $100 million into a blockbuster, generally you're comforted by sticking to a tried and true formula.

With that, let's talk about how superhero movies handle action scenes, act by act.","Welcome to Crash Course Organic Chemistry hosted by Deboki Chakravarti! Starting next week, we'll be tackling the notoriously complicated subject of organic chemistry, and hopefully having some fun along the way!

It seems like every year or so something new comes out and everybody loses their minds over it. A new device, service, gadget, or gizmo quickly dominates the market and every media source is fixated on it. Sometimes these things become permanent features of our lives. For example, it's impossible to imagine a world without computers, smartphones, or social media.

If you thought that you had sway in the world, think again.  You’re measly little instagram following is nothing compared to the families we are about to show you today.  We are exploring just who are the families that have the money, the power, and the fame to make them some of the most influential in the world.  And let’s face it, these are the ones that are pulling the strings.  Whether it’s by tilting politics in their favor, running for political office themselves, or maybe they have amassed social media followings so massive that it would make your head spin, they certainly get things done the way that they want, when they want, and from who they want.  These families are absolutely ruling the world we live in as we go about our daily lives.  Sometimes it’s through their companies that are selling us the things we need day to day, or maybe they are the ones that manage our bank accounts and investments.  Whatever the means, they are the ones in control.  So, stick around, and learn about what families you definity wish you were born into, because if you were, you’d certainly be one of, The Richest.

MY OFFICIAL MERCH IS OUT ► http://www.reactiontime.com​","Follow the legend of Parvati, the Hindu mother of the natural world, as she disappears from Earth and reemerges as Annapurna, the goddess of food. 

--

Historically, the union between Shiva and Parvati was a glorious one: a sacred combination which brought fertility and connection to all living things. Yet a rift had grown between these two forces. Setting out to prove the importance of her work, Parvati withdrew from the world and sent the Earth into darkness. Antara Raychaudhuri and Iseult Gillespie tell the story of the goddess Annapurna.

The history of the keyboard default involves a gaming legend and the start of a new era in games.

To see more of Thresh, check out the eSports episode of Explained on Netflix: www.netflix.com/explained

In this episode of Vox Almanac, Vox’s Phil Edwards explores the history of a common default keyboard configuration among gamers. Though there’s an inherent logic to WASD — it just works well — there’s also a story behind how it became a near-universal standard.

Dennis “Thresh” Fong was one of the first pro gamers to go mainstream playing the first person shooter Quake. By doing so, he set a standard for other gamers to aspire to, including his key control configuration. He discovered that for a new era in which the mouse and keyboard needed to work together, WASD was a great way to do it. Shortly after that, programmers incorporated his schema into their own games, making it a default that millions — whether they knew Thresh or not — would play with. WASD became a standard for a lot of games because of one superstar’s amazing record with it.

AS ALWAYS KEEP IT REAL (⌐■_■)","UV at ground level is non-ionizing but it damages DNA and causes photoaging - how?
Also, it turns out glass doesn't block all UV (specifically UVA passes through). This is something I learned filming with the UV camera inside.

Special thanks to Dr. Hayley Golbach, @hayleysgold on twitter
https://twitter.com/hayleysgold​

Ultraviolet light causes damage to DNA, leads to cancer and photoaging: age spots and wrinkles. I was curious about this because UV is technically non-ionizing. A photon of UV doesn't have enough energy to strip an electron off atoms or molecules. However it does have enough energy to trigger photo-chemical reactions. For example, it causes pyrimidine dimers - the unauthorized covalent bonding of adjacent thymine or cytosine bases in our DNA. If these spots are not properly repaired, they may lead to mutations and cancer. Photoaging is typically the result of degradation of collagen and elastin fibers - scaffolding that supports the skin. This leads to wrinkles and saggy-looking skin.

He’s arguably one of the most powerful men on the planet. He’s the head of one of the largest nations ever to exist. He’s known for his authoritarian ways of governing, and his alpha male demeanor. He’s been the leader of his country for a total of almost 2 decades, and it looks like he’s not going anywhere anytime soon.  Oh, and he also happens to be good buddies with none other than Donald Trump. The man in question we were talking about is none other than Vladimir Putin Russia’s president.  And while he may claim to only live a modest and frugal life, turns out Vladimir Putin may be hiding away a secret fortune. A secret fortune that one total, would make him the richest man on the planet. Richer than Jeff Bezos, richer than Elon musk, richer than Bill Gates. Yeah. This is an extreme fortune. And the thing is, there are tons of clues that hint to him actually being this wealthy. Like his extremely expensive watch collection, his lavish suits, and many houses and palaces that he has throughout his homeland of Russia.  So what’s going on here? Is Vladimir Putin actually this rich? and if so how has he gotten away with keeping his fortune secret for so long? Well don’t you worry. Today were finding out as we talk about the life of Vladimir Putin, how he rose to power, what he spends his money on, and if he actually is secretly the worlds richest man.

As a child, she experienced heartache with the death of her mother on the eve of her teenage years. She endured a number of strict but life-saving years in boarding school–though she came out of them with bulimia, a condition she battled for decades. 

Three marriages and three divorces, the guilt of not spending enough time with her children, and some misunderstood antiwar activism all led her to regret her choices in life. Her brother, the celebrated actor Peter Fonda (of Easy Rider fame) died in 2019. The siblings didn’t spend as much time together as Jane Fonda would have liked. 

Fonda was diagnosed with osteoporosis and has also battled cancer. She has a double mastectomy in 2016, right before attending the Golden Globe Awards as a Best Actress Nominee, and is troubled by skin cancer. 

Despite all the tragedy, Jane Fonda has much to celebrate. She started acting again in the early 2010s, landing award-nominated roles in big-budget movies. And now in her 80s (an age she never thought she’d reach), she’s a proud feminist, a vocal climate activist, and embracing the single life. But you’ll need to watch the video to find out more about the path she took to reach her place of happiness. 

Did you enjoy this deep-dive into the fascinating life of Jane Fonda? If you did, let us know which celebrity you’d like to learn about next. We guarantee you’ll come out of the other side more knowledgeable!

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab​

Skyscrapers are getting skinnier: As cities get denser, architects are designing builders that are taller and taller on smaller and smaller lots. And that poses one big problem: How do you keep them from swaying in the wind? Behind some of the most iconic shapes on our skylines  is a secret design language of architectural tricks —twists, holes, and setbacks— that keep buildings still.

In fact, a recent study conducted by Dr. Alex Schnell from the University of Cambridge, found that cuttlefish passed an adaptation of the 'Marshmallow test', designed in the 1970s to test children's self-control. 

This study is an important piece in the evolutionary puzzle because cuttlefish (and cephalopod) brains are so different from vertebrate brains, and yet appear to support similar cognitive features, such as self-control.

#Cuttlefish​ #MarshmallowTest​ #Evolution​","Zack Snyder's Justice League is finally coming to HBO Max, complete with new look at Jared Leto's Joker, the inclusion of the villainous Darkseid and even the Snyder Cut Martian Manhunter. IGN sat down with Zack Snyder himself to go deep on the Justice League Snyder Cut, with new details on what the four-hour long DC movie means for Superman (Henry Cavill), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and of course the Batman played by Ben Affleck.

In addition to discussing the Zack Snyder's Justice League Snyder Cut trailer reaction, Snyder also debuts an exclusive tease from the movie -- and we get a cameo appearance by Harry Lennick (Martian Manhunter). Plus, he answers all your questions about the near-mythical film.

00:00​ - Intro
01:00​ - What's the latest on the Snyder Cut?
05:30​ - Shift from four-part release to single film
07:20​ - Locked Zack Snyder's Justice League running time

24:00​ - Cyborg's storyline in the Snyder Cut
25:45​ - Joker's addition to Zack Snyder's Justice League
28:20​ - Plans for future Justice League films

35:00​ - How much Knightmare will we see?

About Zack Snyder's Justice League: In Zack Snyder's Justice League, determined to ensure Superman's (Henry Cavill) ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) aligns forces with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions. The task proves more difficult than Bruce imagined, as each of the recruits must face the demons of their own pasts to transcend that which has held them back, allowing them to come together, finally forming an unprecedented league of heroes. Now united, Batman (Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and The Flash (Ezra Miller) may be too late to save the planet from Steppenwolf, DeSaad and Darkseid and their dreadful intentions.

Zack Snyder's Justice League debuts on HBO Max internationally on March 18th.

Tom Hanks is one of the biggest names in Hollywood - not to mention one of the richest as well. He was born on July 9, 1956 in Concord California. He attended high school in Oakland before attending California State University where he studied theater. After spending his summers acting at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Ohio, he caught the attention of talent scouts in New York City and landed the role of Kip Wilson on the sitcom Bosom Buddies.

Or, watch more videos here: 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...​ 

This greater exposure led to more roles on shows like Happy Days, Taxi and The Love Boat. Ron Howard, who was impressed by Hanks performance on Happy Days, cast him in his 1984 hit film Splash alongside Daryl Hannah. 

Tom rose to fame starring in iconic films like Big, Forrest Gump, Castaway and Toy Story. In a 2013 Readers Digest poll, he was ranked as the number 1 most trusted person in America. He got to where he is today with his versatility as an actor and his undeniable charisma. He has been compared to other Hollywood legends such as Jimmy Stewart, Cary Grant and Gary Cooper. 

Hanks is a father of four. Two of his children were from his first marriage to actress Samantha Lewis. The two were wed in 1978 when Tom was just 21 and they had their first child, Colin, two years later. Samantha and Tom had one more child, Elizabeth, in 1982 before getting divorced in 1987. 

Hanks married his next wife, Rita Wilson, in 1988 even though they met in 1981 while was on Bosom Buddies. He and Rita have two children together. Their oldest son Chet was born in 1990 and their youngest, Truman was born in 1995. Tom and Rita also have three grandchildren and they couldn't be prouder to be grandparents. 

This video is going to take a closer look at the Hanks family. At this point, they are practically Hollywood royalty. We'll see what Tom's kids are up to these days and we'll even catch a glimpse of his adorable granddaughters.

--

The human body is made up of about 30 trillion cells that carry a code which has been duplicated over and over for billions of years - with varying degrees of accuracy. So what happens when the system breaks down and the machinery turns on itself, leading to cancer? Greg Foot dives into the science of how biologists are biohacking the human body to try to fix the seemingly unfixable. 

Lesson by Greg Foot, directed by Pierangelo Pirak.

So, to be clear, I've done a thing here that you shouldn't do, which is apply population statistics to individuals. But i did it for a good reason...uh...fun?

Of course there are many things that are likely to affect your age of death as much as or more than your current age (income, location, race, medical history, etc.) But also you gotta understand (and statisticians will hate this video for this reason and probably others) that the an average of life expectancy doesn't tell you much at all about when an individual will die. For example, an change in child mortality changes life expectancy far more than a change in elderly mortality because the addition or removal of small numbers to an average will affect it dramatically.

This is why you'll often hear that the life expectancy in some period of time was 35 years old. That makes it sound like people were all dying around 35, but in fact ages were distributed all over, but there were far more deaths of children and babies, which pulled the average way down. 80 year olds in the middle ages weren't, like, some kind of mythical creature. ""Life expectancy"" just isn't a super useful statistic for telling you what length of life to expect.

Also, it's not even /that/ good at telling you things about public health. People are supposed to die, so a better measure (which Australia actually uses) is ""Years of Potential Life Lost"" or YPLL

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_o...​

The US has a surprisingly bad YPLL because of suicides, drug overdoses, homicide, and car accidents. 

That allows you to study whether diseases kill lots of people who are at the end of their lives or people who might otherwise live a quite a long time. Like, dementia kills mostly very old people while suicide and accidents kill lots of  young people. We shouldn't give those deaths the same weight. 

And then lastly, if you want to go all the way down this rabbit hole, you should google ""Global Burden of Disease"" which endeavors to measure beyond years of life lost and into the quality of those years. Like, disease can cause life-long chronic pain or disability, and those things should be considered as well as death. 

OK, I am surprised by how much I just typed about this!

Some people's lives were improving, thanks to innovations in agriculture and commerce, and the technologies that drove those fields. Lots of people's lives were also getting worse during this time, thanks to the expansion of the Atlantic slave trade. And these two shifts were definitely intertwined.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

When people clean out their fridge, they look at whatever date is on the label and throw it in the trash if it’s past that date. But the chances are that you’re throwing out tons of perfectly good food because date labels on food are often really confusing.

Food labels can mean many different things and often don’t give you any indication of whether the food is safe to eat or not. Many people assume that they’re federally regulated, but baby formula is the only product required to have consistent date labels. For everything else it’s up to the states to decide.

This creates a confusing state-by-state patchwork of labels with everything from “use by” to “freshest before” to “sell by” to “packaged on.” 

And all this confusion causes us to waste tons of food every year. All the uneaten food waste costs Americans over $200 billion each year, and two thirds of that comes from households.

If we came up with a unified, easy to understand date label system we could save money, food, and help the environment, all just by changing how we put date labels on the things we eat.

Pamela Anderson has never been a stranger to the public eye. Likewise, she has never been afraid to bare all in front of the cameras. This is true both of her physical body, as well as her true passions. On top of being an incredibly attractive media personality, Anderson has also made a name for herself by being a passionate activist. She has used her fame to try and help others in many ways. This includes putting an end to the Canadian seal hunt, as well as campaigning for the release of American whistleblower Julian Assange. She also maintains a close personal friendship with Assange, being one of the few public figures who has managed to do so.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...​ 

More recently, Anderson has reminded the world of her past tabloid exploits by partaking in a brief public marriage with Hollywood producer Jon Peters. The two had a brief romantic relationship many years ago, and got back together recently for a marriage that ended up lasting less than two weeks. They both hold differing accounts regarding how the marriage came to be and why it ended, which has left much of the public very curious about the intimate details. This marriage isn't the only reason that Anderson has been in the public eye recently, however. 

No matter what happens, Pamela Anderson still enjoys taking the spotlight, and isn't afraid to reveal herself to the public. This is especially true when she thinks that there's a possibility that she can use her star power to make any kind of positive world change. Whether partaking in proactive business ventures, such as Jasmin, or simply campaigning on social media, Anderson's goal in life is to make as positive of a difference in the world as she can given her stature. Many people are often curious to know how Anderson's looks are holding up, as her looks are arguably what made her a household name in the first place. Those people will certainly be happy to know that Pamela Anderson is looking better than ever in new topless photo.

To this day, he’s considered one of the most wanted hackers of all time. He toyed with society and governments, stole from companies like IBM, rode the busses for free, intercepted phone calls, and manipulated McDonald’s drive-thru speakers just for a bit of fun.

But he never hacked for money, nor did anything malicious with the sensitive date he uncovered. That’s why the FBI wanted to find him, so they could bring him over to their side. 

How many hacking tricks did he pull? And did the FBI finally catch him?  Let’s find out.

Former Rockstar dev, Leslie Benzies, has been working on an ambitious new game that has been cloaked in secrecy, despite the community that has sprung up around it. What we can piece together from patents is that Everywhere will be a multiplayer open-world title set in the near future. Players will be able to buy their own in-game goods such as vehicles and other objects and create content such as minigames. If this sounds a bit like Grand Theft Auto Online to you, it’s because Benzies is considered one of the masterminds behind GTA V’s sprawling online offshoot. And lastly, 343 Industries developers have revealed that Halo Infinite will be missing a few fan-favorite features from entries past.

We would never want to share our planet with some of the fierce prehistoric predators that used to walk-- or swim-- the earth. From the giant megalodon shark that used to lurk in the oceans to the terrifying titanoboa snake that could be more than 40 feet long. But not all evidence suggests that these mysterious creatures are actually gone. Dinosaurs could still walk among us. Maybe they’re just really good at hiding. 

There have been sightings all over the world of strange, unexplainable creatures. From giant direwolves to land-sloths the size of elephants. There are tales of sea monsters like the Loch Ness monster and of giants like bigfoot, who could really just be the mysterious prehistoric great-ape gigantopithecus. We’ve found evidence that we were off by hundreds of thousands of years about when some of these creatures went extinct, like the saber-toothed tiger and the giant birds called teratorns. So couldn’t that mean we’re wrong about them going extinct at all? 

We’ve dug up some of the most prominent legends, sightings, and evidence that suggest that these prehistoric creatures are still alive and well-- and that they’re just hiding in their own elusive parts of our world. From tales passed down through generations to unexplainable footprints, here are all the reasons these “extinct” creatures could still be out there today.

Business Email: imLance210@gmail.com","Milla Jovovich's Captain Artemis encounters the Palico known to gamers as Meowscular Chef in this exclusive scene from director Paul W.S. Anderson's film adaptation of the Capcom video game franchise. Monster Hunter is now available on Digital and will be released on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray ad DVD on March 2, 2021.

Behind our world, there is another: a world of dangerous and powerful monsters that rule their domain with deadly ferocity. When an unexpected sandstorm transports Captain Artemis (Milla Jovovich) and her unit (T.I. Harris, Meagan Good, Diego Boneta) to a new world, the soldiers are shocked to discover that this hostile and unknown environment is home to enormous and terrifying monsters immune to their firepower. In their desperate battle for survival, the unit encounters the mysterious Hunter (Tony Jaa), whose unique skills allow him to stay one step ahead of the powerful creatures. As Artemis and Hunter slowly build trust, she discovers that he is part of a team led by the Admiral (Ron Perlman). Facing a danger so great it could threaten to destroy their world, the brave warriors combine their unique abilities to band together for the ultimate showdown.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

Trump and Nixon are similar in a lot of ways: they both faced major FBI investigations, were accused of obstructing justice, lashed out at the media, and oozed raw sexual charisma. Some pundits look at those similarities and assert that, like Nixon, Trump will also face impeachment.   

But Nixon never had Fox News. As trust in mainstream media has collapsed over the past 40 years, the amount of conservative media has exploded. And sources like Fox News have spent months casting doubt on the FBI and the Mueller special investigation. 

Without a uniting narrative in the media, it’s unlikely Trump will face impeachment or that Republicans in Congress will be the ones to hold the president accountable for his actions, regardless of what Mueller ultimately finds.

ALWAYS STAY SLOTHY \(._.)/","Take a look back at Dolly Parton through the years to see how her image and career transformed from 1967 to 2020. Even after all these years, her look is just as iconic as ever!

00:00​ - Intro
0:20​ - Dolly Parton in the 1960s
Dolly Parton's career started in 1967, when she got her big break on the Porter Wagoner show. From here, it was only a matter of time before her music - and her look - took her career to greater heights.
0:57​ - Dolly Parton in the 1970s
After a few big hits in the early 70s, Dolly Parton began to get widespread recognition in the country music community. She released many albums during this time and even won an ""Album of the Year"" award. However, her career was just getting started, as she was about to make the transition to pop music.
2:05​ - Dolly Parton in the 1980s
Parton started the decade off strong, starring in the film ""9 to 5"", for which she also wrote new music for. Now, she was becoming a Hollywood star and a music legend. She also starred in ""The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"" and ""Rhinestone"", alongside Sylvester Stallone. She'd even get her own variety show in 1987. Now she had everyone's attention - and fans around the world were infatuated with her figure.
4:41​ - Dolly Parton in the 1990s
Now a national icon, Dolly Parton's career really began to take off. In the 90s, she devoted a lot of time to Dollywood, a Disney-esque theme park built around Dolly Parton's name and ""down-south"" lifestyle. She also appeared in ""Straight Talk"" and continued to release music throughout these years.
7:01​ - Dolly Parton in the 2000s
During the early 2000s, Dolly Parton began to change her image a little, mostly with the help of plastic surgery. She has not been shy about her willingness to undergo these procedures, and credits her image largely to this quality. Her legacy continued to grow during these years as she became a household name.
8:44​ - Dolly Parton in the 2010s and Today
Recently, Dolly Parton has solidified her legacy with her entrepreneurial ventures inthe music industry, as well as the continued growth of Dollywood. Recently, she received a Lifetime Achievement Award and continues to be an icon for musicians and actresses of all backgrounds.
10:33​ - Dolly Parton in 2020
Today, Dolly Parton seems to have learned a lot over the years, but she still remains the classic Dolly Parton that we all fell in love with all those years ago. May she have many more wonderful years!

Parton was born on January 19, 1946, in Locust Ridge, Tennessee. Parton grew up poor in rural Appalachia. She was one of 12 children, and money was always an issue for her family. Her first exposure to music came from family members, including her mother, who sang and played guitar. At an early age, she also learned about music while performing in church.  

Parton received her first guitar from a relative and soon began to pen her own tunes. At age 10, she started performing professionally, appearing on local television and radio shows in Knoxville. Parton made her Grand Ole Opry debut three years later. Set on a career in music, she then moved to Nashville after finishing high school.

Parton's singing career really started to take off in 1967. Around this time, she partnered with Porter Wagoner on The Porter Wagoner Show. Parton and Wagoner became a popular duo and the pair recorded a slew of country hits together. Much was made of her shapely curves, petite stature and warm personality, which to some belied a thoughtful, visionary artist with a strong business sense. Since her early career, Parton has protected the publishing rights to her catalog of songs, which has earned her millions in royalties.

Parton's work with Wagoner also helped her land a contract with RCA Records. After having had several charting singles, Parton scored her first No. 1 country hit in 1971 with ""Joshua,"" a bluegrass-inspired track about two solitary figures who find love. More No. 1 hits followed in the mid-'70s. For the range of her compelling work, she won the Country Music Association award for female vocalist in 1975 and 1976.

Parton perhaps reached the apex of her mainstream success in the 1980s. She not only starred with Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin in the 1980 hit comedy 9 to 5, which marked her film debut but also contributed to its soundtrack. The title song, with one of the most memorable opening lines in popular music history, proved to be another No. 1 hit for Parton on both the pop and country charts and earned her an Academy Award nomination. Parton next starred in The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas in 1982, which helped to introduce a new generation to her song ""I Will Always Love You."" The following year she scored another major smash with ""Islands in the Stream,"" her duet with Kenny Rogers.","Try Not To Say WOW Challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)! Have a happy holiday!

The traditional European powers were greatly weakened by years of total war and widespread destruction. The USSR was looking to expand its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, and at the same time, the United States was assisting with the rebuilding of Western Europe (with some hegemonic strings attached). As two nuclear-armed superpowers emerged, the world entered the Cold War.

Wallpapers from The Verge: https://bit.ly/2xQXYJr​","Joe Rogan is by far the most popular podcaster in the world. The Joe Rogan Experience has made Rogan incredibly wealthy, and he has a net worth of about $100 million. Rogan recently signed a massive deal to make the Joe Rogan Experience exclusive to Spotify. The $100 million contract will make him even richer. Rogan became a podcasting giant after starring in sitcoms and performing stand up. The former Fear Factor host still works as a commentator for UFC, but the majority of his wealth comes from his podcast. If you watch the podcast on YouTube, you will see Rogan interview the likes of Elon Musk, Bernie Sanders, Robert Downey Jr., and many other celebrities and scientists. The Joe Rogan Experience is downloaded about 190 million times per month and can make as much as $200,000 per episode. The podcast earned Rogan $30 million from in 2019, and he has spent his millions on muscle cars and sports cars, hunting trips, amazing mansions, and incredible work out equipment. Rogan’s car collection includes a Plymouth Barracuda and a Corvette Stingray, as well as a Tesla that he bought after he interviewed Elon Musk. He travels to Utah to hunt elk and has made elk meat a regular part of his keto diet. Rogan’s luxurious Bell Canyon mansion features a home gym equipped with expensive and high-quality exercise equipment. The gym is packed with Rogue fitness equipment and Onnit weights. Here’s a detailed look at how Joe Rogan made and spent $100 million.

Click below to check the trivia question
https://bit.ly/3rCFiam​
There is not questioning whether or not Knight Rider was an absurd TV show. Of course, it was! But it was also wildly popular and quite entertaining. David Hasselhoff might have been the show's intended star but KITT, the autonomous crime-fighting talking car, clearly stole the show. 

Like this content? Subscribe here: 
https://www.youtube.com/factsverse?su...​ 

Or, watch more videos here: 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...​ 

Knight Rider had a pretty impressive run. 90 episodes and four seasons is more than most shows get to boast about- and you can't forget about all of the made-for-TV movies and the reboots that the show inspired. 

Those obsessed with 80s nostalgia currently have a rare opportunity. If you have an extra half-million dollars or more laying around you can big on David Hasselhoff's personal KITT car. Can you imagine show up to your next Tinder date in that? 

If you want to bid on the car you can visit https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/...​

Are you tempted to visit the Land Down Under? What if we told you that it was home to creatures who boast venom 1,000 times more powerful than cyanide? Plus, there are snakes crawling out of toilet bowls and giant bird-eating spiders roaming around in backyards -- you’ll quickly realise that Australia is not a place for the faint of heart. 

Australia is a country of close to 25 million people. Very, very brave people, because they share their homeland with creepy-crawlies, violent sharks, and herculean-sized crocodiles. 

Are the stereotypes accurate? Are there really dangerous animals around every corner? You better believe it...

One time considered the hardest working man in showbusiness, Jay Leno has now made it his business to amass one of the best car collections known to exist. Instead of hiding those cars away from the public only to trailer them to car shows where they sit behind velvet rope, Leno drives his cars and shares them with the world on his post Tonight Show series, Jay Leno’s Garage. A lot of that show is friends and colleagues of Leno bringing by exotic machinery for a chat and a test drive, but viewers also get a glimpse at some of the unique and memorable cars that call his garage home. From one off specials like the EcoJet and Blastolene to historical novelties like the Stanley Steamer Vanderbilt Cup, Jay Leno’s collection contains some amazing vehicles. Custom Outlaw Porsches, the hand built MTT Y2K Jet Bike, to the world's first super car the Lamborghini Muira, Jay Leno’s car collection is about as unique as they come. While he’s not afraid of modifying a car over 100 years old to make it more useful, Leno has also managed to turn his collection into a living history of the automobile and innovation. His car run on gas, steam, kerosine, E85, and electricity. There are even visits from other crazy cars, like the Batmobile Tumbler from the Christopher Nolan Batman movies. Let’s take a look at some of the craziest things parked in Jay Leno’s garage.

When you think about it, it is very weird that most people get the choice of whether or not to create another another human being, but I'm very happy we live in a world where we do (mostly) get to make that choice. And, frankly, I'm not super good at decisions. Katherine and I can't decide where to go for dinner most nights, let alone whether we want to un-alterably change our lives forever.

But now that I've been a parent for BASICALLY NO TIME AT ALL but while I'm still a little bit capable of remembering what my life was like before I was a dad...I just wanted to share some thoughts.

Since his debut in 1978, George Clooney has come a long way, and the actor's three Golden Globes and two Academy Awards prove that not just his good lucks but also his talent and hard work have helped him reach here.

Life could have gone in a completely different direction for George Clooney. In middle school, he developed Bell's palsy which partially paralyzed his face. Clooney was fortunate as the condition receded on its own after a year. However, when it came to acting, Clooney wasn't so fortunate. He did not get his big break immediately and instead, struggled for years. During his struggle days, George Clooney took up various odd jobs to make ends meet. He worked as a construction worker, cut tobacco in a factor for money, and sold insurance and women's shoes. Though life may have tested him in the beginning, it surely has given him a lot in return. Today, George Clooney is one of the most popular and celebrated actors in the world. In this video, we tell you some interesting facts about the actor.

It was a tough week for Texans, yet Senator Ted Cruz decided he didn’t want to hunker down in the Lone Star state! Texas fell under a severe snowstorm, causing residents to be stuck in their homes without access to electricity, plumbing, and even food. Sadly, over 30 people died during the snowstorm.

While Texans had to brave the cold, Ted Cruz had escaped down to sunny Cancun. He stated he wanted to be a “good dad” and take his daughters on a trip after school was canceled in the state.

We’re sure the Cruz family had fun in Mexico, yet Texans had nothing to celebrate. His trip caused an uproar throughout the state. He decided to return to Texas the day after arriving in Mexico. There’s still much confusion on whether he only planned a day trip, or if he changed his plans due to the controversy.

Upon hearing the news that the senator had left Texas in the midst of one of the worst snowstorms in its history, the Twitter mob was quick to blast his actions. Journalist Ana Navarro-Cárdenas tweeted that Ted Cruz had “fled to Cancun...while his constituents are sleeping in their cars and burning furniture to stay alive.”

Model Padma Lakshmi also attacked the senator for his actions. Former House member Beto O’Rourke also snidely criticized Ted Cruz for vacationing while Texans were “freezing to death.”

Upon returning to Texas, the senator declined to give details about his vacation. He did, however, have the Houston Police Department monitor his movements due to any potential threats.

He stated that his priority was to restore power and water throughout the state. He expressed his concern for the millions of Texas who were suffering.

What lies ahead for Ted Cruz due to this controversy is still up in the air. This short-lived vacation will linger in the minds of Texans for much longer. Find out more about how Ted Cruz’s untimely vacation is causing an uproar!

Can you imagine owning a mansion so large, so expensive, that it needs a round-the-clock security team? 

For superstar couple jennifer lopez and Alex Rodriguez, that idea is no dream, it’s a reality - a $33 million reality. While that number is nearly incomprehensible for most of us, for the A-list lovers, whose combined net worth is close to $700 million, it barely even makes a dent in that beefed-up bank account.

Their most recent real estate acquisition is jam-packed with all of the features you could ever want: pool, spa, sprawling garden, high-tech synchronization, gym, entertainment spaces, and plenty more. But it’s not their only house,  nor is it their only lavish purchase. Prepare yourself for jealousy as we take a look at this infamous duo’s jaw-dropping new pad.

It’s not just happening at protests, either: sometimes police violence is captured in everyday life.

On June 2nd, a traffic stop in Baytown, Texas turned violent when a couple friends began to question the arrest of a black man. One man recorded the clip and it went viral, but it didn’t end there. It set off a ripple effect across his life and the city of Baytown, Texas.

What happens when someone uses technology to glare back at police interactions? For Isaiah Benavides, it may have put him in harm’s way.

This video is part of a larger project at The Verge that looks at the power and consequences of filming police violence. Verge Science investigates what police body cameras don’t show you — check that out here: https://bit.ly/2YNuFFY​

Donald Trump is the 3rd president in American history to be impeached by the House of Representatives, joining Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Richard Nixon resigned before the House voted on the articles of impeachment.

But this is the middle, not the end, of the impeachment process – Trump is now officially charged with the abuses of power laid out in the House’s articles of impeachment, but will be tried in the Republican-majority senate. But what will congressional Republicans accept, and what will that mean for future presidents?  What we know so far paints a dangerous picture.

The Personal Tragedies of Vanna White from Wheel of Fortune","Subscribe for more amazing videos! ► http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest​ ◄

Elon Musk is one of the richest people in the world, and he briefly surpassed Jeff Bezos to become the richest person ever. He has a net worth of about $177.2 billion, and he earns approximately $266,666 every minute despite never taking a paycheck from Tesla. Musk is paid via a lucrative compensation package that awards him stock options if Tesla meets certain performance goals. Musk received $50 billion in stock options when Tesla’s market cap reached $650 billion, which wasn’t expected to happen until 2028. Few people expected Tesla to become so valuable so quickly, and today the EV maker has a market cap of about $764.25 billion. Today, Musk owns about 241 million shares of Tesla which is approximately 25% of the company. The company's recent success has made Musk incredibly rich and the trend shows no sign of slowing down. At the beginning of 2020, Musk was worth a mere $27 billion, but by the end of 2020 his net worth stood at about $167 billion. That means his net worth increased by an average of $383,561,643 per day in 2020 or about $15,981,735 per hour. Musk makes nearly 5.5 times more money in a single minute than the average American makes in an entire year. Musk’s net worth is tied to Tesla’s share price. The higher the stock price climbs, the richer Musk becomes. Musk also owns 48% of SpaceX, and his stake in the company is worth about $46 billion. Here’s a close look at how quickly Elon Musk makes money.

--

For centuries, billiard balls were made of ivory from elephant tusks. But when excessive hunting caused elephant populations to decline, they began to look for alternatives. John Wesley Hyatt took up the challenge. In five years, he invented a new material called celluloid, which would become known as the first plastic. Trace the history of the material that ushered in the “plastics century.”

In this week's Processor episode, Dieter Bohn looks at the launch of Android ten years ago. The HTC G1, codename Dream, was the first commercially available phone that ran Android and it was released more than a year after the iPhone. But, here's the thing, Android wasn't meant to compete with Apple. Instead, Google was actually trying to compete with Microsoft.

You'll learn about Herakles' 10 actually 12 labors, the story of his birth, his death, some of his marriages, none of which turned out that great, and some of his character flaws that definitely wouldn't fly in the modern world.

Kurt Vonnegut found the tidy, satisfying arcs of many stories at odds with reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune in his own novels. He tried to make sense of human behavior by studying the shapes of stories — ditching straightforward chronologies and clear-cut fortunes. Mia Nacamulli dives into the sometimes dark, yet hopeful works of Vonnegut.

Sitting around a campfire, you can feel its heat, smell the woody smoke, and hear it crackle. If you get too close, it burns your eyes and stings your nostrils. You could stare at the bright flames forever as they twist and flicker in endless incarnations… But what exactly are you looking at? Elizabeth Cox illuminates the science behind fire.

The NEW FROZEN LEGENDS Pack in Fortnite...","SPOILERS! Director Zack Snyder elaborates on how Lois Lane would have played into Superman's downfall in his planned Justice League sequel, while producer Deborah Snyder explains the significance of Superman wearing only his black suit in The Snyder Cut of Justice League.

Zack Snyder's Justice League debuts on HBO Max on March 18.

In Zack Snyder's Justice League, determined to ensure Superman's (Henry Cavill) ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) aligns forces with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions.

The task proves more difficult than Bruce imagined, as each of the recruits must face the demons of their own pasts to transcend that which has held them back, allowing them to come together, finally forming an unprecedented league of heroes. Now united, Batman (Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), and The Flash (Ezra Miller) may be too late to save the planet from Steppenwolf, DeSaad, and Darkseid and their dreadful intentions.","The Tesla Model Y is Elon Musk’s fifth car ever to hit the road, and the company’s second attempt at a mass-market electric vehicle. Due out in 2020, the long range version will travel 300 miles on single charge, and will sell for $47,000, while the $60,000 performance version will be capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. “It has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,” Musk said.

Can't Stop Won't Stop - Mighty & High
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPi3Z...​","Turns out there’s a lot of chemistry in cooking.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

Ever notice the first step for baking a cookie is almost always to preheat the oven to 350 degrees? 

Even when you’re baking something else, an oven with a digital temperature reader typically defaults to 350. What’s so magical about this number and why is it that so many recipes call for it? 

I spoke with longtime pastry chef and Institute of Culinary Education creative director Michael Laiskonis and found that – as with most “magical” things – it’s actually science.

2020 has been a year of heartbreak and tragedy for many. The lockdown orders particularly affected a lot of couples. People that had once thought they loved one another were forced to live in close quarters for a long period of time, and they ended up learning a lot of nasty surprises about each other. While the quarantine did leave a lot of couples feeling closer to one another than ever, it also led to a spike in breakups and divorces.

A shocking amount of celebrity couples also chose to end things in the year 2020, although not all of these breakups and divorces were due to spending more quality time together during quarantine. While even normal people can change partners rather frequently, this is even more obvious in celebrities.

These Celebrities Split Up for Good in 2020

While some celebrities do get together out of genuine love for one another, this isn't always the case. A lot of celebrities begin dating because they know it will make sensational headlines. And even if they aren't getting together for the attention, their intentions aren't always romantic. Love and family aren't always priorities for celebrities, especially when they've got a sea of attractive people to choose from.

Many celebrities also become involved in passionate affairs despite being married already. Hollywood actors are especially notorious for becoming involved in all sorts of scandals. Part of this can be attributed to the sort of loneliness that many celebrities feel. Being so separated from other, ""normal"" people can make it hard for them to make new connections. As a result, the moment they sense any kind of attraction towards a fellow celebrity, they are often quick to jump into a heated romance.

However, these brief but passionate romances do make sense on another level. Famous actors and musicians have to go on tours or to far away filming locations to keep up with work. This means that a lot of celebrity couples find themselves split apart way too often, and they simply can't keep up their careers and romance at the same time.

Finally, another common cause of celebrity breakups is the amount of pressure they are subject to. When paparazzi find out about a new celebrity romance, they spend all of their time and energy hunting the couple down for photos and videos. The couple will often begin to feel that their private lives are being violated, and ultimately decide to end their relationship as a result.

In today's video, we're going to take a look at the most famous celebrity couples that split up in 2020. Make sure you stick around, because we're going to reveal the sad reason why Megan Fox ended her marriage of 10 years!

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountainous area in the Caucasus region between Europe and Asia. For more than 30 years, it's been locked in a conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The fight between the two countries began in the early 20th century but became a frozen conflict for 60 years while the whole region was under the control of the Soviet Union. 

When the Soviet Union fell, newfound independence sparked a brutal six-year war in the region, where Armenia emerged victorious. From 1994 to 2020, Armenia controlled Nagorno-Karabakh, while Azerbaijan rebuilt its military. Fighting erupted again in summer 2020, and Azerbaijan went on the offensive — eventually capturing most of Nagorno-Karabakh and dramatically reshaping the region.

William Daniels is an American actor from Brooklyn. He was born in 1927 and got his first taste of show biz when his family formed a traveling song-and-dance troupe. He made his television debut back in 1943 when he was still just a teenager. A couple of years later he made his Broadway debut in the 1939 comedy Life With Father.

For the next couple of decades, Daniels was predominately a stage actor. In 1963 he made the jump from stage to screen in Ladybug Ladybug. In 1965 he starred in the comedy A Thousand Clowns. Perhaps his most famous film role was in 1967 when he played Dustin Hoffman's father in The Graduate.  

In the 1970s, Daniel found success portraying John Adams in the film adaptation of 1776 - a role that he had previously played on the Broadway stage. He would continue to reprise the role of Adams for the net several years on various spin-off television programs.  

In the 80s, he played the voice of KITT the car in Knight Rider. He followed that roll up by playing Dr. Mark Craig in St. Elsewhere from 1982 to 1988.  

In 1993, he signed on to Michael Jacobs ABC sitcom Boy Meets World as Mr. Feeny, Cory, and Eric Mathews sagely teacher, neighbor, and advisor. That role ended up being one of the most iconic that Daniels would play in his exceptionally long career. He'd reprise the role in 2014 in the sequel series Girl Meets Role.

https://bit.ly/3rCFiam​
Intended to compete with The Addams Family, The Munsters was a fun and spooky television series that kept fans engaged for years. But it's been more than 50 years since the show aired. Today, we're taking a look at The Munsters cast then and now to see how they've changed through the years.

00:00​ - Intro
0:19​ - Mel Blanc as The Raven
1:24​ - Beverly Owen as Marilyn Munster
2:55​ - Pat Priest as Marilyn Munster #2
4:20​ - Al Lewis as Grandpa Munster
5:25​ - Yvonne De Carlo as Lily Munster
6:32​ - Fred Gwynne as Herman Munster
7:47​ - Butch Patrick as Eddie Munster

The Munsters is an American sitcom depicting the home life of a family of benign monsters. The series starred Fred Gwynne as Frankenstein's monster and head-of-the-household Herman Munster; Yvonne De Carlo as his wife Lily Munster; Al Lewis as Lily's father, Grandpa, the somewhat over-the-hill vampire Count Dracula who longs for the ""good old days"" in Transylvania; Beverley Owen (later replaced by Pat Priest) as their teenage niece Marilyn Munster, who was attractive by conventional standards but the ""ugly duckling"" of the family; and Butch Patrick as their werewolfish son Eddie Munster. Produced by the creators of Leave It to Beaver, the series was a satire of both traditional monster movies and the wholesome family fare of the era. It ran concurrently with the similarly macabre-themed The Addams Family (which aired on ABC) and achieved higher figures in the Nielsen ratings.

In 1965, The Munsters was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series, but lost to The Rogues. In the 21st century it received several TV Land Award nominations, including one for Most Uninsurable Driver (Herman Munster).

The series originally aired on Thursday at 7:30 pm on CBS from September 24, 1964, to May 12, 1966; 70 episodes were produced. It was cancelled after ratings dropped to a series low, due to competition from ABC's Batman, which was in color. ""Munsters"" star Butch Patrick said, ""I think ‘Batman’ was to blame. ’Batman' just came along and took our ratings away.""  But The Munsters found a large audience in syndication. This popularity warranted a spin-off series, as well as several films, including one with a theatrical release.

On October 26, 2012, NBC aired a modern reimagining of The Munsters called Mockingbird Lane as a pilot. The series failed to be picked up by NBC due to disagreements on the dark nature and inconsistent tone.","Host Sarah Hyland is joined by her friend and stylist Brad Goreski to play a game of “Straight Answers from a Gay Man.” Brad, a self-proclaimed vagina rookie, is put to the test to find out his knowledge of female anatomy.

There are nearly a million known insect species in the world, but most have one of just five common types of mouthparts. Why is this information useful to scientists? Anika Hazra explains how the features of an insect’s mouthparts can help identify which order it belongs to, while also providing clues about how it evolved and what it feeds on.

Lesson by Anika Hazra, animation by Giulia Martinelli.

http://www.instagram.com/notryanhiga​","I'm sorry if this one is dense! Rarely do I feel like I really need more than four minutes, but this time I did!! Two things I've been thinking about:

1. When I say that shared worldviews and knowledge helps us communicate and work together, I don't mean that we CANNOT work together without shared stories...obviously we can! I just think that education provides us with shared knowledge that allows us to work together more effectively. I honestly think this is one of the main benefits of college education...just giving people shared frames to simplify communication. Which, of course, is terrible when higher education is denied to people who can't afford the ludicrous costs and then people are like, ""There's just some reason why it's a little harder to work with people who didn't go to college"" or, worse, ""This person doesn't know about X or Y thing and so they must be stupid"" when, actually, they just didn't get the EXACT SAME education as you, asshole. We need to get better at working with people who do not have shared frames, and that should be part of education.

2. Being the kind of person for whom barriers to success were basically non-existent does NOT mean that success is guaranteed. Both luck and hard work are necessary even when there are no barriers. But the absence of a barrier is not the same thing as luck for me. To me, luck is writing a Harry Potter song that got me invited to a Harry Potter convention that resulted in me meeting a conference organizer who helped me build VidCon. Luck is not being born with enough money in the bank that I never had student loans...while almost all of my peers did have student loans. That's structural inequality. I think getting confused about that can lead to a lot of successful people thinking that, just because they had to work hard AND get lucky, that anyone on earth could have had the same outcome with the same luck and hard work. 

3. Oh, and also, turns out there were three. Success is arbitrary and it is what you decide it is and individualist narratives are also narratives that re-inforce a very specific thing as the best possible outcome. While many people find a great deal of satisfaction in lives that won't be written into books AND THEY SHOULD.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab​

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently announced a plan to bring congestion pricing to New York City. The goal is to raise money for the city’s crumbling public transit system and reclaim the dangerously busy city streets. But what is congestion pricing, and can it actually solve all our transit woes? 

We took a look at London, a city that enacted a congestion charge in 2003, to see some of the benefits. Check out the video above to learn more.

For further reading look to our sister site, Curbed: https://www.curbed.com/​

And a closer look at how much money is wasted sitting in traffic:

Finally – Check out this article by Nicole Badstuber on how London congestion pricing has started to level out and the plans the city has in place to bring revenue back up:

Today, we're going to talk about the differences between reference maps and thematic maps, take a closer look at how projections play a part in how we perceive maps, and discuss the role of the cartographer (or map maker) in all of this. Maps are incredibly powerful tools and play a crucial role in how we understand the world, but they are also made by people, so it is our job to think critically about how these stories are being presented to us.

To see how students across the country really felt about school shootings, we put out an open request for students to send us their thoughts. Here are some of their responses. 

Gun violence, particularly school shootings, ranks among the most contentious issues in America. Since the February 14, 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL, mass shootings have again become a staple of the news cycle.

This school shooting is distinguished from previous ones, because students around the nation have rallied to organize for safer schools. Whether that means stricter gun control, metal detectors, regulating ammunition sales, or arming teachers, remains unclear.

A quantum computer works in a totally different way from a classical computer. Quantum bits or 'qubits' can exist in a superposition state of both zero and one simultaneously. This means that a set of two qubits can be in a superposition of four states, which therefore require four numbers to uniquely identify the state. So the amount of information stored in N qubits is two to the power of N classical bits.

--

Deep in the Amazon rainforest in the river Nea’ocoyá lived a school of particularly big and tasty fish. When the rains came and the water rose the fish appeared, and swam away as the waters fell. Villagers along the river followed them to a lagoon and set up camp. But their young shaman soon sensed they might not be completely alone. Nathan D. Horowitz details the Siekopai myth of the air goblins.

Russell Wilson has a net worth of about $135 million, and he recently signed a lucrative four-year contract extension worth $140 million. He’s one of the highest paid players in the NFL, and he uses his extraordinary wealth to buy antique cars, fancy mansions, and gifts for his family. Wilson has lucrative endorsement deals with many companies. He earns about $20 million per year thanks to his Nike deal, and last year he earned $89.5 million from salary and endorsements. Wilson also has partnerships with Microsoft, Bose, Alaska Airlines, Braun, and Luvo.

Wilson bought a brand-new house for his mom on Mother’s Day and purchased a Mercedes-Benz G Wagon for his wife on Valentine’s Day.  Wilson has a very impressive real estate portfolio. He owns a mansion in Bellevue, Washington that he purchased in 2015 for $6.8 million, but it’s likely worth a lot more now. The 10,210 sq.-ft. mansion sits on 6.7 acres and has 7 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, and a home gym. The mansion’s stunning kitchen has gorgeous chandeliers, a spacious center island, a walk-in pantry, and high-end wood cabinetry. Wilson threw an extravagant birthday party for his wife Ciara when she turned 35. The pair celebrated on a private yacht, and Wilson bought Ciara a luxury Hermes Birkin handbag worth at least $10,000. Keep watching to see how Russell Wilson earns and spends his money.

At age 12, Kathryn convinced her parents to let her buy and begin restoring a 1986 Pontiac Fiero with $450 in babysitting money. Over the past two years, she has painstakingly restored every part of her Fiero by hand, quickly learning advanced mechanical skills such as welding, grinding, upholstering, sandblasting -- even how to rebuild an engine.

With dad Jerry as her loyal project partner, and plenty of automotive know-how from Uncle Bob, Kathryn has embarked on an epic journey that is shattering gender stereotypes, inspiring thousands, and opening doors she never imagined. Watch and learn how Kathryn's project earned her an invitation from General Motors to attend the 2013 Detroit Auto Show and hang out with two female engineers from the original Fiero team.

FORTNITE ICE STORM EVENT RIGHT NOW! (FORTNITE BATTLE ROYALE)","EPISODE DESCRIPTION

The English Theater survived a lot of pushback from various powers that be, but in the 17th century, it had to go into hiding, from PURITANS. Let's take a look at how the English Civil War, Charles I's beheading, and the Restoration of the monarchy all had effects on the English Theater. Also, not to bury the lede, but WOMEN finally make it to the English stage in this episode. Plus, Restoration comedies are pretty smutty, so you should hang on 'til the end of this one.

Jason: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYd-...​","Does quantum entanglement make faster-than-light communication possible?
What is NOT random? http://bit.ly/NOTrandoVe​
First, I know this video is not easy to understand. Thank you for taking the time to attempt to understand it. I've been working on this for over six months over which time my understanding has improved. Quantum entanglement and spooky action at a distance are still debated by professors of quantum physics (I know because I discussed this topic with two of them).

Does hidden information (called hidden variables by physicists) exist? If it does, the experiment violating Bell inequalities indicates that hidden variables must update faster than light - they would be considered 'non-local'. On the other hand if you don't consider the spins before you make the measurement then you could simply say hidden variables don't exist and whenever you measure spins in the same direction you always get opposite results, which makes sense since angular momentum must be conserved in the universe.

Everyone agrees that quantum entanglement does not allow information to be transmitted faster that light. There is no action either detector operator could take to signal the other one - regardless of the choice of measurement direction, the measured spins are random with 50/50 probability of up/down.

AS ALWAYS KEEP IT REAL (⌐■_■)","Here is the official trailer for The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, which will premiere on Disney+ on Friday, March 26, 2021. Set in present-day Minnesota, the Mighty Ducks have evolved from scrappy underdogs to an ultra-competitive, powerhouse youth hockey team. After 12-year-old Evan Morrow (Brady Noon) is unceremoniously cut from the Ducks, he and his mom, Alex (Lauren Graham), set out to build their own team of misfits to challenge the cutthroat, win-at-all-costs culture of youth sports today. With the help of Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez), they rediscover the joys of playing just for the love of the game.

#JimmyFallon​","This mega yacht, owned by Russian Billionaire, Olgeg Tinkov, was specifically designed to break through ice, in the arctic and antarctic ocean waters. Worth nearly a hundred million, wait until you see the inside! 

We can tell you from experience, today’s video is unlike any other, for we cover the lifestyles of the incredibly wealthy quite a lot.  From the clothes they buy, to the savvy business decisions they’ve made, to the fast cars, and of course, the most lavish parties you’ve ever heard of are all the norm when you’ve got a billion dollars.  But today, we have found a boat that puts all others to shame.  Many billionaires love their yachts, but this one is so much more.  It’s a true exploratory vessel.  Built to fare the harshest climates the world has to offer.  All while keeping it’s guests in the lap of luxury unheard of by the average citizen.  It’s the one and only La Datcha 77, a brand new boat commissioned by the legendary billionaire Oleg Tinkov, who you may have heard of from his stake in the banking industry (the man own’s Tinkov banks after all).  But just what makes La Datcha 77 so special?  How does it keep its passengers happy while travelling out into the coldest regions of the globe?  And just what is there to do on this boat that you won’t find on others?  And hey, what’s the food like on this ship?  We’ve got all those answers and more on this episode of The Richest, where we break down exactly what you will find on the La Datcha 77, and what makes it unlike any other super yacht in the world.  Get ready for adventure, and luxury.

His reign marked the beginning of one of history’s greatest empires … and the end of one of its first republics. Was Rome’s first emperor a visionary leader who guaranteed his civilization’s place in history, or a tyrant who destroyed its core values? Peta Greenfield and Alex Gendler put this controversial figure on trial in History vs. Augustus.

When historians talk about the atrocities of the 20th century, we often think of those that took place during and between the two World Wars. But two months before the Rape of Nanking in China, and a year before Kristallnacht in Germany, a horrific ethnic cleansing campaign occurred on an island between the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. Edward Paulino details the 1937 Haitian Massacre.

When it comes to air travel, most of us are used to the *ahem* comforts, of coach class.  For a few of us, maybe with a bit of luck on your side with a fancy upgrade, you’ll get to travel in the much more spacious business class.  But for the elite of the elite, there’s only one way to travel that is literally miles above the rest.  We are talkin of course about First Class, and frankly, there’s nothing else like it.  First class is the premiere way to travel through the air.  The seats are comfier, the leg room more spacious, the service friendlier, and the price?  Yeah.  It’s A LOT more.  But what EXACTLY do you get with the priciest of the pricy first class tickets?  Do you really get more bang for your buck?  After all, tickets in this tier can go for as much as $20,000 dollars… or more.  ONE WAY.  So, enough speculating.  Just what can you get by paying that much for a plane ticket?  Time for you to sit back, relax, and put that tray table up, and enjoy a pre-flight beverage (complimentary of course!) as we let you in on the truth behind the most expensive first class flights that are available… and what you’re getting for your money.  We can assure you, it’s gonna be a really great flight, especially if you take a trip by buying a First Class ticket on the flights we’ve got on our list today.

Yellowstone is a neo-western drama television series created by John Linson and Taylor Sheridan. It appears on the Paramount Network and stars Kevin Costner, Kelly Reilly, Luke Grimes, Wes Bentley, and Gil Birmingham.

The series follows the ongoing conflict between the Dutton family, the Native American reservation that borders their land, and the internal soap opera conflict between various members of the family. The show touches on political subjects, substance abuse issues, and the struggles of contemporary Native Americans. 

The program is in its fourth season and has received critical acclaim that has been all but unanimous. This video is going to take a look behind the scenes and show you some of the struggles and hurdles that producers, cast, and crew had to go through during its production. 

Throughout the show's production, there has been controversy and scandals that have kept producers scrambling to keep their names out of the mud. For example, Harvey Weinstein was a co-producer before he went down for his sexual abuse crimes. Kelsey Asbille claimed to be of native descent but the tribe she claimed heritage from had no record of her having any connection to them. Peta, the animal rights advocacy group, has also attacked the show for its alleged use of real cows to depict a scene that involved bovine mutilation. 

Of course, production on any show has its kinks and hardships. Yellowstone is one solid show and Kevin Costner gives the performance of a lifetime. If you haven't seen it yet, you're really missing out.","Smile More Store: http://RomanAtwood.com​

Two men, Estragon and Vladimir, meet by a tree at dusk to wait for someone named “Godot.” So begins a vexing cycle where the two debate when Godot will come, why they’re waiting and whether they’re even at the right tree. The play offers a simple but stirring question- what should the characters do? Iseult Gillespie shares everything you need to know to read the tragicomedy.

This force was originally identified while studying the trajectories of cannon balls (though earlier observations of this effect exist). The Magnus force is essential in most ball sports including golf, cricket, tennis, and baseball.

At the end the ball demonstrations were conducted with a 100 mm diam polystyrene ball and the launcher was made by bending a long, thin, aluminum rod and bolting the ends to a block of wood as a handle.

This video is not actually about how to write a book, if anything it's about how to find the motivation, which I think (for me at least) was a lot more important. I think I realized that, often, I wasn't writing a thing because it wasn't that important to me, I wasn't that excited about it, and ultimately I was more into the idea of having people read a book I wrote than I was into the idea of writing a book. 

I'm not saying you don't need that first thing, but t helps to have the second one too. 

I also 100% recognize that this is all much easier if you don't have to worry the whole time about whether a publisher or agent will at least read your book and whether you have friends who are published authors who will help you revise and and vouch for you (thank you Patrick Rothfuss for that, btw.)

So, yeah, things are easier to do if you see the path, and understand where you might fit in.

Gunsmoke is an American radio and television Western drama series created by director Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston. The stories take place in and around Dodge City, Kansas, during the settlement of the American West. The central character is lawman Marshal Matt Dillon, played by William Conrad on radio and James Arness on television. When aired in the United Kingdom, the television series was initially titled Gun Law, later reverting to Gunsmoke.

The radio series ran from 1952 to 1961. John Dunning wrote that among radio drama enthusiasts, ""Gunsmoke is routinely placed among the best shows of any kind and any time."" The television series ran for 20 seasons from 1955 to 1975, and lasted for 635 episodes. At the end of its run in 1975, Los Angeles Times columnist Cecil Smith wrote: ""Gunsmoke was the dramatization of the American epic legend of the west. Our own Iliad and Odyssey, created from standard elements of the dime novel and the pulp Western as romanticized by [Ned] Buntline, [Bret] Harte, and [Mark] Twain. It was ever the stuff of legend.""","GET NEW MERCH HERE: lance210.com​

On January 8th, 2020 the Trump administration announced that it was terminating the Temporary Protected Status of approximately 260,000 Salvadorans who live in the US. As a result, Nelsy Umanzor, a Salvadoran TPS holder, is now at risk of losing the temporary legal status that has allowed him to work and raise a family in Maryland for the past 17 years. But he won’t be giving up his status without a fight. Umanzor is lobbying congress to turn TPS into a path to residency before his status expires.

Billy Brown, beloved Brown family patriarch and star of the popular reality TV series, Alaskan Bush People, has died. His son, Bear Brown, posted the news on his Instagram account, stating that Billy Brown passed away surrounded by family and friends following a seizure. He is survived by his devoted wife, Ami Brown, five sons and two daughters, Matt, Bam Bam, Bear, Gabe, Noah, Bird, and Rain, and three grandchildren.

Best known for his wild mountain lifestyle, survival skills, and big family values, Billy Brown was also an accomplished author and beloved father. 

While there were indeed moments of scandal and intrigue over the thirteen seasons (and we take a look at those in our video), Billy Brown was not afraid to show his sensitive side. From teaching Gabe to drive to bringing home a puppy for his youngest daughter, Rain, Billy was all heart when helping his family. 

The family is no stranger to tragedy. At the age of 57, wife Ami Brown was diagnosed with a particularly aggressive form of lung cancer. The doctors gave her a shocking 3 percent chance of survival. With her family’s support, including a move to California to undergo specialist treatment at the UCLA Medical Center, Ami overcame the illness. The mother of three was declared cancer-free in 2018. 

In 2016, the Alaskan Bush People were embroiled in a fraud scandal, which ended in a dramatic court case, 30 days home detention, and a fine for Billy Brown and his son, Bam. With support from their fans, the family quickly recovered from the drama, and their wholesome, God-fearing Brown family reputation remained intact. 

With their patriarch gone, will there be a Season 13 of the Alaskan Bush People? Bear Brown says yes, writing on his Instagram that the episodes have already been filmed and will feature his wedding to fiance Raiven Adams.

THANKS FOR WATCHING, LOVE YOU GUYS!
- FaZe Teeqo","Do we take the Earth for granted? It gives us life and sustains us in the manner we're accustomed to, but we don't know the first thing about it: like where did it come from? And how did it form? Most people recognize that the Earth has a big explosion in its history, which they refer to descriptively as the 'Big Bang.' But there are two very good reasons why the Big Bang is not directly responsible for forming the Earth: 1) It happened 13.7 billion years ago. That's more than 9 billion years before the Earth formed (what happened during that time?), and 2) After the Big Bang the universe consisted of only Hydrogen and Helium - not great raw material for building the Earth. The truth is the big bang formed stars, which exploded and then (perhaps) formed more stars, which exploded and then formed our solar system, including the Earth. The early stars performed the vital role of making the heavier elements of which Earth is composed and we are made.","We've had Pokémon remakes but what about... pre-makes?

I can understand exactly how my internal calculus is changing and why AND that it's something that I HAVE DONE TO MYSELF, but it still feels entirely real to me. 

Anyway...very curious to here people's thoughts on all of this...

--

In May 1940, with the German army ready to occupy Paris, Noor Inayat Khan was faced with a difficult choice: stand on the sidelines or join the Allied forces fighting the Nazis. After witnessing the devastation across Europe, she travelled to England to learn the art of espionage. Shrabani Basu details how a pacifist turned spy helped build the resistance that toppled a fascist regime. 

Lesson by Shrabani Basu, directed by Franz Palomares.

So far in this series, we've mostly focused on how AI can interpret images, but one of the most common ways we interact with computers is through language - we type questions into search engines, use our smart assistants like Siri and Alexa to set alarms and check the weather, and communicate across language barriers with the help of Google Translate. Today, we're going to talk about Natural Language Processing, or NLP, show you some strategies computers can use to better understand language like distributional semantics, and then we'll introduce you to a type of neural network called a Recurrent Neural Network or RNN to build sentences.

In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we’re learning about electronegativity, polarity, resonance structures, and resonance hybrids. We’ll practice a very important skill for this course that will help us avoid a lot of memorization in the future: electron pushing. It’ll be a lot of trial and error at first, but we all start somewhere!

Brecht wanted to lean into the idea of theater as a tool to upset and educate the world about stuff like the struggles of the working class and the problematic aspects of capitalism. He wanted to SHOCK people into seeing the world as it is and taking action, rather than merely entertain audiences. But, he messed up, and wrote some pretty entertaining stories, with some really catchy music integrated into it. And do, people ended up whistling Mack the Knife instead of throwing off the shackles of an oppressive social order. To be fair, it is a catchy tune. Today you're going to learn about Brecht, Epic Theater, and a little bit about the House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Because those jerks hauled Brecht up in 1948 to shake him down about whether or not he was a communist.

Join the Video Lab! http://bit.ly/video-lab​

Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein has been reimagined onscreen hundreds of times and is a staple of pop culture. The prevailing takeaway is science-gone-wrong and the dangers of pursuing the unnatural. But contemporary readers, surrounded by Enlightenment-era scientific breakthroughs that were beginning to shift the definition of death, would have read the story as frighteningly plausible. 

Electricity was being used in a scientific practice called “galvanism,” which seemed to show some promise in reanimating body parts of recently dead animals and humans. Shelley even references galvanism in the 1831 edition of the book, citing it as an example of how this experiment could be a possibility.

He's not the one-trick-pony oddball that you might think him to be. 
 
Tiny Tim AKA Herbert Butros Khaury was born in 1932 to immigrant parents that worked in the textile industry. They never expected their son to be the superstar that he later became. He had a fascination with music from a young age despite the fact that he was a rather lackluster student. 
 
He's a self-made man. He worked very hard to get to the top. Most of his younger years were spent playing in clubs for next-to-nothing and performing as a sideshow act in Time Square. A few lucky breaks got him featured in some rather obscure feature films before attracting the attention of The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and various other variety shows. 

He's released a dozen or so records and has never deviated from his signature falsetto style. Unfortunately, his health has always plagued him, and it was his persistent heart problems that proved to be the death of him. Find out the heartbreaking truth about his demise. This video is sure to be a tear-jerker, so be warned.

You need to follow its rules, or you're not allowed on iOS. But app developer Riley Testut has a new strategy for distributing mobile apps outside the App Store, and it's called AltStore. It's an alternative app store for the iPhone that lets you install any app, without needing to jailbreak your phone or install an enterprise certificate. He built it initially as a way to distribute his Nintendo emulator Delta, but now he thinks it could support all kinds of software Apple doesn't allow on the App Store. And the best part: anyone can download it.

--

At a Maryland country fair in 2017, farmers reported feverish hogs with inflamed eyes and running snouts. While farmers worried about the pigs, the department of health was concerned about a group of sick fairgoers. Soon, 40 of these attendees would be diagnosed with swine flu. How can pathogens from one species infect another, and what makes this jump so dangerous? Ben Longdon explains.

When it comes to mainstream news, few celebrity figures are as prominent as Anderson Cooper. Since the introduction of his CNN show Anderson Cooper 360&#2013265922​; in 2003, Anderson has become a household name amongst television viewers looking for the inside scoop on what's going on. In 2012, Anderson publicly came out as gay. Three years later, he began dating a man named Benjamin Maisani. They moved in together during their three-year relationship. In 2018, the two broke up. However, they remained living together and still considered themselves close friends.

Few people raised an eyebrow at Anderson and Benjamin's living arrangement until in April of 2020, when Anderson's son was introduced to the world. Thanks to the help of a surrogate, Anderson was now the father of a baby boy named Wyatt. Wyatt was named after his late father, who tragically passed during Anderson's childhood. Benjamin was present during the child's birth, and Anderson soon publicly announced that he was going to include Benjamin in Wyatt's life as a co-parent. This came in spite of Anderson's insistence that there was no possibility of him and Benjamin ever getting back together romantically.  

Although many have made comments about Anderson and his son's living arrangement with Benjamin, Anderson has never been the type to care what others think. At the age of 17, Anderson threw the comforts of his wealthy family out the window and travelled to Africa on a survival trip that lasted several months. From there, Anderson started a career in journalism that saw him traveling to war-torn nations and reporting raw footage from on the scene. In this early period of his career, he travelled to nations such as Rwanda and Vietnam, becoming desensitized to the violence he saw. His journalistic fame eventually landed him his CNN show, and he has remained in the public spotlight ever since. Join Facts Verse as we take a look at why Anderson Cooper is living with his ex-boyfriend.

Not everybody knows the names Robert Urich and Heather Menzies, but they will likely recognize them from some of their famous roles. Robert Urich made a name for himself in television during the 80s as a tough guy on shows like VEGA$ and Spenser: For Hire, while Heather Menzies is perhaps best known as one of the Trapp children in The Sound of Music. The two married in 1975, and would go on to lead an incredibly happy Hollywood marriage with three children. However, their fairy-tale life would eventually end in somewhat of a tragedy.

Robert Urich began suffering from a rare kind of cancer during the 90s, and his wife stuck by his side every step of the battle. However, despite their best efforts, Urich eventually succumbed, leaving behind his wife and three children. Unwilling to give in to the void that was left in her late husband's wake, Menzies went on to dedicate her life to finding The Robert Urich Foundation, a foundation dedicated to researching cancer and helping cancer patients cope and recover. However, this wouldn't be the end of the tragedy. The story of Robert Urich and his wife is a sad tale, but also one that there is a good deal of hope in. As well, it's one that we could all stand to learn a thing or two from as we go about our daily lives.

--

In the 16th century, physician Andreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal could be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea and blowing air to inflate its lungs. Today, Vesalius’s treatise is recognized as the first description of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. So how do our modern ventilators work? Alex Gendler explains the life-saving technology.

Horseshoe Bend used to be a little-known roadside view of the Colorado River in Page, Arizona. But over the past few years, the spot has witnessed a dramatic increase in popularity. The main culprit for that uptick? Instagram. It’s now one of many hidden treasures across America that have become too popular for their own good — requiring extensive redesign to protect the visitors and the environment. With visitation at a record 84 million in 2017, America’s national parks are more popular than ever — and social media is rewriting the rules of how and why people visit them.

We'll talk about how stores know what we want to buy (which can sometimes be a good thing), how baseball was changed forever when Paul DePodesta created a record-winning Oakland A's baseball team, and how statistics keeps us safe with the incredible strides we've made in weather forecasting. Statistics are everywhere, and even if you don't remember all the formulae and graphs we've thrown at you in this series, we hope you take with you a better appreciation of the many ways statistics impacts your life, and hopefully we've given your a more math-y perspective on how the world works.

The 1970s was an exciting decade, which brought critical cultural changes. There are many images and memories that we can associate with this decade; but, they do not tell the whole story.

Many people tend to assume the reality about the 1970s as an era clearly differentiated from others, from the beginning to the end of this beautiful decade. 

The truth about the 1970s is a bit more complicated than what we associate with it. But this does not detract from this decade. Knowing all that is hidden behind popular beliefs, you will see how this decade was one of the richest and most varied in modern history. 

In 1970, many of the important changes that began in the past decades were consolidated. People began to discover much more about themselves. In an age plagued with individualism, the cultural and social boom reached other levels and marked a before and after human history. 

But don't let them fool you; there were no absolutisms in the 70s. In this video, we will teach you some things you should know about this decade so that you understand the whole picture. 

Many of the events of the 1970s are partially recounted but don't worry. You are not the only person who does not know the real story behind the 1970s. After watching this video, you will learn new information that will change your perception of the world. 

If you enjoyed the video as much as we did doing it, don't forget to let us know by clicking the like button.

Anthony Rivera: https://goo.gl/5AB4c5​","Swedish DJ and producer Eric Prydz and his team make wild, incredible, expensive limited-run events. His latest is his most ambitious — and potentially, his shortest run ever. In this episode of The Future of Music presented by Aloft Hotels, The Verge explores the behind the scenes of EPIC 6.0: Holosphere. After years of development, the multi-story transparent LED sphere only saw one performance at Belgium’s Tomorrowland festival. It’s been two years in the making and we got an exclusive look behind-the-scenes at what it takes to build the most technically advanced EPIC (Eric Prydz In Concert) to date.

The Gilligan's Island cast featured everyone's favorite castaways, and delivered some of the most-watched television of the 60s when it aired from 1964 to 1967.

 But, a lot has changed since then. Today, we're taking a look at the Gilligan's Island cast then and now, to see how they've changed through the years.

00:00​ - Intro
0:15​ - Vito Scotti as Dr. Boris Balinkoff
1:21​ - Russell Johnson as Professor Roy Hinkley
2:26​ - Natalie Schafer as Lovey Howell
3:31​ - Jim Backus as Thurston Howell III
4:36​ - Alan Hale Jr. as Captain Jonas Grumby
5:41​ - Dawn Wells as Mary Ann
6:46​ - Bob Denver as Gilligan
7:51​ - Tina Louise as Ginger

Vito Scotti played Dr. Boris Balinkoff, but he also played many roles on Broadway, in films, and on television, from the late 1930s to the mid 1990s. He was known as a man of a thousand faces for his ability to assume so many divergent roles in more than 200 screen appearances in a career spanning 50 years and for his resourceful portrayals of various ethnic types.

Russell Johnson is known for his role as Professor Roy Hinkley. He was also known for Marshal Gib Scott in Black Saddle. He reprised this character for three Gilligan's Island made-for-television movies and two animated series. In a 2004 interview, Johnson commented about the role and shared his perspective regarding Gilligan's Island and the situation comedy's place in television history: ""It used to make me upset to be typecast as the Professor...But as the years have gone by, I've given in. It's brought a lot of joy to people, and that's not a bad legacy."" Johnson died from kidney failure at his home in Bainbridge Island, Washington, on January 16, 2014, aged 89.

Natalie Schafer performed in many films, usually portraying sophisticates; including ""Lovey Howell"" on Gilligan's Island. She reprised her role in made-for-television spin-off films after the show ended, along with the animated spinoff Gilligan's Planet in 1982. Schafer died of liver cancer in her Beverly Hills home, at the age of 90.

Jim Backus was best-known for his role as Thurston Howell III, but he also played James Dean's character's father in Rebel Without a Cause, he voiced Mr. Magoo, and he starred in his own show of one season, The Jim Backus Show, also known as Hot Off the Wire. Backus was an avid golfer and made the 36-hole cut at the 1964 Bing Crosby Pro-Am tournament. On July 3, 1989, Backus died in Los Angeles from complications of pneumonia after suffering from Parkinson's disease for many years.

Alan Hale Jr. had a television career spanned four decades, but he was best known for his co-starring role as Captain Jonas Grumby. Hale appeared in more than 200 films and television roles from 1941, and also appeared on several talk and variety shows. In addition to acting, Hale co-owned Alan Hale's Lobster Barrel, a restaurant he opened in the mid-1970s. The Lobster Barrel was located on La Cienega Boulevard on Los Angeles's Restaurant Row. Hale died on January 2, 1990, of thymus cancer at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles at age 68.

Bob Denver is best known as Gilligan, and he continued to appear as Gilligan in several movies, as a guest on other television series, in personal appearances, and as a voice actor in the animated version of the series. On September 2, 2005, Denver, a heavy smoker, died at age 70 from complications following throat cancer surgery.

Dawn Wells is best known for her role as Mary Ann Summers. Following Gilligan's Island, Wells embarked on a theater career, appearing in nearly one hundred theatrical productions as of July 2009. 

Tina Louise is best known for playing movie star Ginger Grant. Over time, she became unhappy with the role and worried that it would typecast her. The series ended in 1967 and she continued to work in film and made guest appearances on television. Louise declined to participate in any of three Gilligan's Island reunion television films. Despite maintaining a steady acting career after the series ended, she stated repeatedly that the show had actually ruined her career.

With support from Google’s veteran community, a group of U.S. veterans ranging from a Google employee to a retired Admiral shared firsthand stories about the value of coming forward and asking for help. 

This is Alexis' story. She’d planned on a military career, but fallout from a sexual assault led her to leave the Air Force academy. Now enrolled with her local VA, she's getting therapy, and moving her life forward.

Whether you're looking for clinical support or just a peer to talk to, help and support are available for veterans. Find veteran-focused support at: https://g.co/servingveterans​. #veteransupport​

On April 4th, Kennedy received news that Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated and in the midst of political speeches he addressed the situation at a rally in the heart of inner city Indianapolis.

Kennedy's address was intended to dampen the potential violence that might occur that night, and was successful. He gave the crowd a reason to stay positive and follow in the footsteps that King had started. RFK dealt with this emotional and race fueled tragedy and reassured predominantly black local supporters that he personally stood with them in this very emotional time.

This episode of PODIUM features: Adam Frankel, Robert Lehrman, and Charlton McIlwain.

A Very Special Thanks to Evan Phillip Freed for providing photographs taken of Robert F. Kennedy along the campaign trail in 1968.

#JimmyFallon​","Dig into the discovery of antidepressant drugs, how they work, and what we still don’t know about depression.

--

In the 1950s, the discovery of two new drugs sparked what would become a multi-billion dollar market for antidepressants. Neither drug was intended to treat depression at all— many doctors and scientists believed psychotherapy was the only approach to treatment. Neil R. Jeyasingam details the decades-long journey that followed and how it revolutionized our understanding of depression.

Lesson by Neil R. Jeyasingam, directed by Skirmanta Jakaitė, Art Shot.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab​

North Carolina’s Cape Fear River is a massive water system. It stretches across the lower half of the state, collecting runoff from 29 counties and providing water to millions of people. But in the city of Wilmington, where the river meets the Atlantic Ocean, the water has residents worried. 

In a 2019 test of tap water, Wilmington and neighboring Brunswick county were among the top five areas for high levels of PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — a group of man-made chemicals commonly used for making nonstick or water-resistant products. Now North Carolina is reckoning with the legacy of pollution upstream — and discovering what decades of PFAS contamination means for the rest of the country.

Welcome back, Richest fans! If he hasn’t been tearing up the court, the Chicago Bulls icon has even made his name in cinema thanks to Space Jam. Now that he’s retired, Michael Jordan has been keeping himself busy with business dealings. As such, he’s worth A LOT of money. So, with that excess cash, what is a billionaire to do than use one of the best superyachts around that’s worth millions, JOY. The boat even comes with a basketball court on board! Today, we’re going to look at all the incredible facts and features of this yacht. We’ll see how much it’s worth and how much it costs to rent it for a week.

Now for the spoiler paragraph. If you like surprises, we suggest you stop reading and watch the video multiple times. Firstly, we’ll see the brief history of Joy. Such as how it was seen with the NBA legendary player just off the coast of Saint Barthélemy, or Saint Barts as it’s also known. We’ll then dive into the features. Including what else the basketball court can be used for and the price of a Technogym treadmill! There’s also the stunning rooms and spa onboard. We’ll even see the fees for a number of tenders the vessel has hidden within. We’ll then explore just how mammoth Jordan’s net worth is and where the cash comes from. Finally, we’ll briefly look at the most expensive pair of sneakers sold at auction. Which just happens to be from the Air Jordan brand!

That left me at a loss...so I decided to talk to a few people...some who had engaged in package theft and one psychologist, Dr. Robert Tyminski, who wrote ""The Psychology of Theft and Loss."" I've come away from that feeling like I understand this phenomenon a lot better, though I still feel like it's way more complicated than I really get. And as I say in the video, understanding this behavior does not excuse it, and this behavior still makes me really frustrated and mad. 

Mark Rober's Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoxhD...​

Dr. Tyminsky's book: https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-The...​

Andrew Huang's new album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN0nv...​

The full conversation between me and Dr. Tyminski: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOIQe...​

And here's what was up with two of the situations being staged (From Mark Rober)
""I put a feeler out for people willing to put a package on their porch and this person (who is a friend of a friend) volunteered to help. To compensate them for their time and willingness to risk putting a package on their porch I offered financial compensation for any successful recoveries of the package. It appears (and I've since confirmed) in these two cases, the 'thieves' were actually acquaintances of the person helping me.""

Someone has tripped the magical alarms in the Element Temple. When you and the other monks arrive on the scene, you know you have a disaster on your hands. Four young apprentices broke into the temple’s inner chamber to steal the sacred element crystals. But when the alarm went off they panicked, and each of them swallowed a crystal. Can you determine who ate which crystal? Alex Gendler shows how. 

Lesson by Alex Gendler, directed by Artrake Studio.

Bob Newhart is one of those legendary comedians and actors who is instantly recognizable for his appearance, voice, and signature style. He's well known for his deadpan style of comedy, as well as his iconic stutter that adds a whole lot of humor to his routines. He began his career in 1958, and has been gracing the screen and the stage ever since. With a career that's over six decades long, it's surprising that the 91 year old actor doesn't seem to be ready to stop anytime soon! Still, longtime fans are always grateful to see that Bob Newhart hasn't lost his edge after all this time.

While Bob Newhart could have easily settled down at a boring desk job, he pursued dreams of the stage because he knew it would make him feel the most fulfilled.

It took guts for Bob Newhart to completely change his goals so late in life, but he was greatly rewarded. Today, people all over the country can instantly recognize that deadpan voice and signature stammer. Bob Newhart has such a unique stage presence that he's guest hosted The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson a total of 87 times, and his many guest star appearances across various television shows keep him well in the public eye.

Throughout his career, Bob Newhart has released nearly eleven comedy albums, starred in several of his own sit-coms, and appeared in countless films and other television shows. Having perfected his signature style, directors and producers are frequently asking him to appear in their work. After all, nobody can truly compare to Bob Newhart's style.

This video's title has been updated to reflect the results of the election.

Brazil just held potentially the most important election in its history on October 28th, 2018. Two candidates faced off; Fernando Haddad represented the Workers’ Party, which has been in power for much of the past two decades. His opponent was far-right congressman Jair Bolsonaro, who won the election in part by positioning himself as a political outsider with no part in Brazil's sweeping corruption.

With soaring crime and rampant corruption in government, Brazilian voters showed they are eager for change — a desire Bolsonaro effectively capitalized on. But with his deeply offensive rhetoric toward minorities, many Brazilians are worried about their safety and the future of their country's democracy.

Can't Stop Won't Stop - Mighty & High
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPi3Z...​","The Alice cast, starring Linda Lavin and many other memorable names, is likely the secret to this sitcom's successful 9-year run. But a lot has changed since the series ended in 1985. Today, we're taking a look at the Alice cast then and now to see how they've changed through the years.

00:00​ - Intro
0:17​ - Charles Levin as Elliot Novak
1:22​ - Celia Weston as Jolene Hunnicutt
2:26​ - Philip McKeon as Tommy Hyatt
3:32​ - Diane Ladd as Belle Dupree

Polly Holliday left the show to star in her own spin-off series, Flo. In the episode airing February 24, 1980, Flo leaves to take a hostess job in Houston. On the way to Houston, Flo stops at her hometown Fort Worth, Texas (which she refers to by its moniker ""Cowtown""). Flo decides to buy and run a failing roadhouse bar there, which she renames Flo's Yellow Rose. Polly Holliday never made a guest appearance on Alice after beginning Flo, although flashback including Flo were shown in the final episode of Alice. Vic Tayback made one guest appearance on Flo.

Diane Ladd, who received an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Flo in the film version joined the cast in 1980 as Isabelle ""Belle"" Dupree, a hard-edged but kind-hearted woman. She had been a waitress of Mel's in the past, during which the two had a romantic relationship. Despite Ladd's Golden Globe-winning performance as Belle, the character was not retained for the duration of the series and was replaced early in 1981, the character making one last appearance in which she telephones the diner to inform everyone that she had taken a job as a backup singer in Nashville, Tennessee. It has been said that Ladd clashed with her co-stars, and no flashbacks including Belle were shown during the series' final episode.

Theatre actress Celia Weston then joined the cast as the good-natured, boisterous truck driver Jolene Hunnicutt, who came from Myrtle Point, South Carolina. Jolene arrives as she and her male driving partner are in the midst of an argument over his unwelcome advances, during which she throws and breaks many of Mel's dishes. Mel agrees to hire her ""temporarily"" to work off the cost of the dishes, but she stays until the end of the series. Jolene frequently mentions her grandmother, ""Granny Gums"", who had only three or four teeth. Jolene also mentions her distant relative Jefferson Davis ""Boss"" Hogg, a character from the concurrent CBS series The Dukes of Hazzard. In one episode Sorrell Booke guest stars in this role, along with fellow Dukes character Enos (Sonny Shroyer).

The latter years of the show focused on some character development, such as the hasty courtship and marriage of Vera and lovable cop Elliot (Charles Levin). Tommy eventually goes to college and is seen less frequently. The final story arc began in the spring of 1985, when country singer Travis Marsh (played by Lavin's real-life husband Kip Niven), discovering that he's falling for Alice, ""kidnaps"" her to take her to Nashville, telling her it's time to follow her dream there. Bewildered at the thought of her dreams finally coming true, Alice agrees, but not without extracting a promise from Travis to drive her back to Phoenix so she can get her affairs in order, including ending her current relationship with a writer.

In the series finale, which aired March 19, 1985, typical of sitcoms of the era, news of several life-changing events is revealed within a matter of minutes. After 9 years of trying, Alice finally gets a recording contract and is moving to Nashville with Travis Marsh. Vera announces she is pregnant and decides to be a full-time mother, Elliott having been promoted from officer to detective. Jolene's ""Granny Gums"" dies and leaves her enough money to open her own beauty parlor in her hometown. Besides all three waitresses suddenly leaving simultaneously, by an amazing coincidence Mel has just sold the diner for a large amount of money to a real-estate developer and must close within days. On closing day, he surprisingly gives each waitress a $5,000 farewell bonus. The remainder of the episode shows flashback to humorous and major events, and many of the big stars who had appeared on the show, including Polly Holliday. Finally, while cleaning out her locker, Alice finds the ""Waitress Wanted"" sign that first drew her to the diner. The series' regular customers, including Henry, Chuck, and Earl, say their emotional farewells, followed by Elliot, and finally the principal characters Tommy, Jolene, Vera, and Alice. The last thing we see is Mel putting up the ""Closed"" sign and locking up.","BEST DESSERT EVER! Pizza + Cookies = PIZOOKIE!

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

Carbon cycles through earth at a steady pace. Plants and microorganisms absorb carbon, which helps them grow. Animals and bacteria eat the plants, breathe out carbon into the atmosphere, and take some carbon underground when they die. And a similar process happens in the ocean. It's nearly a closed loop, although some plants and animals don't decay fast enough so they turn into fossil fuel, which traps the carbon underground. But one animal started to dig up that carbon — and burn it.

All of the sounds or handshapes in a language can be pronounced differently depending on the context, but in different languages, these differences may be significant, or not. The study of these patterns and variations is known as phonology. In this episode of Crash Course Linguistics, we’ll learn all about phonology and the different phonological systems we see in different languages, and we’ll begin to retrain our brains in order to gain a better understanding and appreciation for phonological patterns.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

While oil spills have declined over the years, they still happen, and when they do, it can be devastating to the environment. One natural way to help contain oil spills is through the use of hair booms and hair mats. Hair is a naturally hydrophobic and biosorbent, which means, it repels water and can collect heavy metals and other contaminants, like oil. 

The more popular methods to contain oil spills use synthetic materials and chemicals, which can be costly and just as dangerous to environment. So, it’s worth exploring eco-friendly ways to clean up the ocean and other waterways.

You can learn more about how hair-booms and hair mats can be used during oil spills on Matter of Trust’s website: https://matteroftrust.org/297/clean-w...​

It looks like nothing more than a tiny floating tablet on a cloth-covered stand. That display has something called Ambient EQ, which automatically adjusts to the light in the room to look more natural.

And he likes it.

Lake Powell is the reservoir created by Glen Canyon Dam. A reservoir is a lake formed by a dam and right there in the name you can see it's main purpose...to reserve. It was part of the Colorado River Storage Project, the goal of which was to store water from the flood times to be used during the dry times. And it's worked, it has allowed a lot of people to live and far in arid parts of the South West US. 

It's also a very pretty and very cool lake that a lot of people enjoy recreationally. But the fights against dams on the Colorado river were a huge part of the early environmental movement in the 1960s, and the reaction against technology that that movement created set up a dichotomy that I don't love.

I am a big fan of the environment, but I often think that a bias toward ""naturalness"" (whatever that means) can cause a lot of pretty big problems, like a fear of vaccines or genetically modified foods. 

There are lessons to learn from these projects, of course. Glen Canyon Dam's construction left it vulnerable to floods, which almost caused a massive disaster in the 1980s. And so there is much to be said for caution.

Basically, it's complicated...and I like having a chance to look at a complicated issue and admit that I'm a little bit on both sides.

Here's a documentary about people who want to remove the dam:

The creepy corners of the ocean are no place for the faint of heart.

The night-black depths of our oceans are as fascinating as they are fearsome. Not only do fang-toothed, blood-sucking creatures scurry around on the seafloor, but they do so as they pass by mysterious objects that, in their own right, are enough to evoke nightmares.

What’s a giant crucifix doing at the bottom of Lake Michigan? Where did the hundreds of unidentifiable skeletons hiding in a Himilayan mountain come from?

The World Wide Web is built on the foundation of simply linking pages to other pages with hyperlinks, but it is this massive interconnectedness that makes it so powerful. But before the web could become a thing, Tim Berners-Lee would need to invent the web browser at CERN, and search engines would need to be created to navigate these massive directories of information. By the mid 1990’s we will see the rise of Yahoo and Google and monolithic websites like Ebay and Amazon, forming the web we know today. But before we end our unit on the Internet we want to take a moment to discuss the implications of Net Neutrality, and its potential to shape the Internet's future.

https://bit.ly/3rCFiam​
Liam Neeson is best known for being an action movie star in films like Taken and Non-Stop. Even though he seems to shine most brightly in these kinds of roles, he is actually quite the versatile actor. He proved that he can tap into his romantic side in Love Actually. He appealed to a younger audience in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe and he tapped into his spooky side in 1990s Darkman.

Neeson is an outspoken advocate for many causes. We'll touch on a few in this video. It's important to note that Neeson isn't afraid to speak his mind nor is he too shy to take action when the situation calls for it. Unfortunately, this has gotten him into hot water on more than one occasion. We're going to take a closer look at the shocking time that Neeson once punched a student in the face that was threatening him with bodily harm. 

We're also going to dissect some of Neeson's weaknesses and strengths. He has been able to overcome so many of his personal struggles by facing them head-on. He's not afraid to take the necessary action required to better his life and the lives of those around him. 

Neeson is a family man - despite the fact that he is a widower. When his wife passed away, he stepped up to the plate and gave his kids all the love and support that they needed to get through that traumatic time period. We'll also touch on some of the ways that Neeson has not only touched his children's lives but also how he shows his support and appreciation to his fellow crew members and colleagues.","Want more DONGs?

http://www.youtube.com/jakechudnow​","The CIA is notorious for spying, but after what these German agents just confirmed, we bet you have no idea just how deep their secrets went! 

On the surface, a Swiss company called Crypto was the world leader in secrecy. Unless you held the code, any messages sent via their encryption devices were impossible to read and interpret. It was the ultimate tool for war, for crime, and for covert international operations. Over 120 countries relied on the Crypto AG encryption equipment from the 1950s well into the 2000s - totally unaware that each and every secret message they sent was being hijacked, falling straight into the hands of the CIA.

It’s been called the intelligence coup of the century, and it’s more cunning, more deceitful, and more complex than we ever could have imagined.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

Few Americans alive today have ever seen unemployment numbers as bad as they are right now. At the end of April 2020, economists estimated that between 13 and 18 percent of US workers were unemployed. It's the highest rate since the Great Depression. 

That figure can seem somewhat inevitable; the unfortunate but unavoidable cost of economic lockdown. It’s why, in response, Congress has prioritized shoring up unemployment insurance benefits.

But a handful of European countries have shown that mass unemployment isn’t a given in a situation like this. It’s a policy choice. 

In this video, we explain how and why the UK, Denmark, and the Netherlands chose a different path. With the help of economist Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute, we explore whether the US can still avoid millions more job losses.

Slow Mo Rainbow Flame - The Slow Mo Guys
Filmed at 1000fps with the Phantom Flex 4k","Over two decades after the original Pokémon Snap, New Pokémon Snap seems poised to prove that seeing Pokémon interact in the wild is still really dang neat.

New Pokémon Snap arrives over two decades after its immediate predecessor and has those many years' worth of thoughts, feelings, and visions of the Pokémon world to reckon with -- plus, like, almost 800 more Pokémon. Since its predecessor, the mainline games have moved solidly into 3D and we now see wild Pokémon roaming open fields as a matter of course. We've also watched them co-exist with humans in fanciful ideas of a true Pokémon world in Detective Pikachu and other media, and even snapped our own goofy AR interactions with Pokémon through Pokémon Go. So surely, by this time, the magic of seeing Pokémon living their lives in a more natural, lifelike setting has worn off, right?","Thanks to Cancer Research UK! http://www.cancerresearchuk.org​

The New FISHSTICK SKIN in Fortnite..","Universal background checks won't fix America's gun crisis. But there's something else that might.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab​

It seems like after every mass shooting, politicians talk about expanding background checks for gun buyers. But background checks don't actually do a great job of keeping dangerous people from getting guns. What does? A licensing system, where before you can buy a gun, you need a license from the state.

* Dig deeper into Massachusetts' licensing system on Vox.com:

Christopher Walken has surely secured his name as one of the most fascinating and unique actors in the history of films. In classics ranging from Pulp Fiction, The Deer Hunter to Annie Hall, he has given one after the other, superior performances that are going to be remembered for many more decades to come. Walken is like a chameleon, always doing things in languages and movements that are always unexpected but also always believable.

He has appeared in almost every genre of movies you have possibly come across: Comedies such as Wedding Crashers, The Dead Zone-like horror flicks, some musicals such as Pennies from Heaven and, of course, crime thrillers like the King of New York have played host to the actor's talents. The celebrity producer and screenwriter has fought Batman and James Bond. If some actors can be titled the kings of Hollywood, Walken is surely among them. 

And as you may already be expecting, such a special, intriguing man has had a very strange and interesting life. As a result, he has a legion of fans - but, we are sure, that even the most diehard of those who do not know all the odd twists and turns Walken's life has taken. To know more about the surprising facts about Walken's life, hit the play button.

In the category of classic TV shows, only a handful are as adored as Gilligan's Island.

Check out some of the awesome Gilligan's Island merch you can add to your memorabilia collection!
https://amzn.to/38Sar3e​

The 1960's show narrated a story of a boat ride that had gone terribly wrong. So wrong that eventually the passengers were stranded on a remote island and were compelled to fend for one another and, of course, themselves.

Enough hilarity ensues as the show's skipper, his bashful helper, a millionaire, and his professor wife, and other personalities deal with their unconventional island life - and also with each other. Gilligan's Island is an exemplary staple of sixties programming and a lot of viewers continue to love the series even today. But, one of the show's most notable stars developed a disreputable relationship with the show and reportedly ran into several difficulties with her castmates. Stay tuned to hear about the star, the cast, and other unknown and unusual things about the beloved show. We are sure you will love knowing those.

From crocodiles with jaws powerful enough to snap bones in half, to snakes that can deliver enough venom to take down multiple targets within minutes, and even giant, ancient turtles ready to devour anything in their path - including humans - the reptile family is not one to be messed with.

Mammals are the largest and insects are the most annoying. But, hands down, reptiles are the most dangerous, terrifying and sinister animal group on the planet. 

Some victims are fortunate enough to have access to antivenom and immediate medical attention. Other victims, however, aren’t so lucky.

https://bit.ly/3rCFiam​
Best known for her role as Charlie Harper's housekeeper Berta, Conchata Ferrell was an American actor who appeared on stage, on television, and in films many times over her career. Before her role as Berta on CBS's Two and a Half Men made her famous, she was probably best known as the housekeeper from the 1979 film Heartland. The 77-year old actor has assayed many supporting roles over the years, including that of Attorney Susan Bloom on L.A. Law and several others on Edward Scissorhands, Erin Brockovich, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Conchata Ferrell passed away on October 12, 2020, of complications from a cardiac arrest. She is survived by her husband Annie Anderson, daughter Samantha, and two stepdaughters. While Ferrell mostly did well in blunt, authoritative, and take-no-crap characters, her co-stars maintain that this was her on-screen persona, and in real life, Ferrell was warm, friendly, kind, and a good friend. In this video, we're remembering the actor and looking back at some of the lesser-known facts about her.

The starting price of $2,399 is the same price as the previous 15-inch MacBook Pro, which this one replaces. It has new processors, better speakers, and (obviously) a larger screen. But I know the most important question you have is whether the keyboard is any good.

A recent UN report predicts we may see as many as 1 million species extincts, many as soon as within the decade. Wildlife Insights is a new Google Cloud -based platform that applies AI to identify animals in images from camera traps placed in the wild. AI helps reduce the arduous manual work of sifting through millions of camera trap images and helps biologists spend more time actually working to study and protect wildlife.

Longtime friends Pernell and Rod co-founded BLK & Bold Coffee in 2018, and since then it’s grown to a 12 person operation. By adding the Black-owned badge to their Google My Business listing, they’re connecting with customers in Google Maps and Search who are looking to support Black-owned businesses. And with 5% of their proceeds going to support at-risk youth, the more BLK & Bold grows, the greater their impact.

Welcome back, Richest fans! Antarctica has enjoyed a number of vital expeditions over the years. With that, those scientists and researchers have made a number of strange discoveries on the icy land. Today, we’re going to look at the most impressive items that have been found in the snow. On top of this, we’re also going to examine some amazing facts from the region. Many of which impact the world in massive ways. Of course, we’ll also see just how much each fact and discovery is worth.

Now for the spoiler paragraph. If you love surprises, we suggest you stop reading and watch the video multiple times. Firstly, we’ll look at perhaps the first time there was a Tinder date in the Antarctic! We’ll then see the history of sled dogs on the continent and why they were banned. There’s also the huge number of different time zones across the land to examine. Antarctica was responsible for the biggest ever recorded iceberg! We’ll look at the only two ATMs on the continent and how they get fixed! There are the amazing lakes under the ice. Such as the massive Lake Vostok! There’s the Antarctic Springtail and how this critter is helping us catalogue plastic pollution. We’ll look at the many meteorites found in the snow that NASA keeps an eye on. We’ll take a gander at the permanent towns on Antarctica such as Esperanza Base. Finally, we have the shocking consequences seen in the region due to climate change.

The Migaloo super-submarines are the future of both private submarines and superyachts. These innovative homes-at-sea come in four different options (the M2, M4, M5 and M7) and feature everything from helipads, swimming pools and jacuzzis to underwater observation decks and their own mini-submarines. Their design is based on Navy-class submarines and they blow private subs like the Phoenix 1000 right out of the water. But they also come with an incredible price tag-- the base model is estimated to cost at least $1 billion, while the top tier model will set you back about $2.3 billion.

If you’re ever dreamed of feeling like a Bond villain with your own private underwater lair, then the Migaloo is probably for you. The interiors are completely customizable so you can decorate your villainous hide-out in whatever way you like, and you can store your helicopter, jet skis and boats right on board. If you really want to have the most exclusive sea-life imaginable, then you can even splurge for the matching private island that’s not really an island at all. Kokomo Ailand is another Migaloo design that puts actual private islands to shame. It’s a floating habitat complete with live trees, gardens and waterfalls, as well as pools, a shark-feeding station, an underwater dining room, and a glass elevator that’ll take you to your own penthouse suite. Here’s everything you can’t wait to know about the innovative Migaloo designs, and why it’s the most exclusive-- and expensive-- submersible superyacht in the world.

Up next: The case for Bernie Sanders: http://bit.ly/2wdX38E​

This video is one of a series in which Vox writers argue the cases for the leading Democratic candidates in the 2020 election. (Vox does not endorse individual candidates.)

The case for Bernie Sanders: https://youtu.be/1PjNlBV-_s8​ 
The case for Joe Biden: https://youtu.be/4c5fuOPCeYw​
The case for Elizabeth Warren: https://youtu.be/VBpmYDLECF8​
The case for Pete Buttigieg: https://youtu.be/0yT7hpF654k​ 

And you can read our cases for all the candidates, including Mike Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, at http://vox.com/the-case-for​

Former Vice President Joe Biden has been a familiar face in American politics for decades. And he’s built his long career on personal relationships — relationships with fellow Democrats, but also with Republicans. More than any other candidate in this race, Biden’s campaign is defined by his belief that consensus among the parties isn’t only possible. It’s preferable. 

It’s an outlook shaped by Biden’s past experiences, and in an election defined by competing visions of the future, Biden’s nostalgic style stands out. But Vox’s Laura McGann argues that the case for Biden is all about where, and with whom, that moderate, nostalgic message will resonate. Because if you look to the election that won Democrats the House of Representatives in 2018, the message that drove that victory looks a lot like Biden’s.

So: What is that message exactly? What are Joe Biden's politics? And why are so many people convinced he can beat Donald Trump?

On July 26, 1943, Los Angeles was blanketed by a thick gas that stung people’s eyes and blocked out the Sun. Panicked residents believed their city had been attacked using chemical warfare. But the cloud wasn’t an act of war. It was smog. So what is this thick gray haze actually made of? And why does it affect some cities and not others? Kim Preshoff details the science behind smog.

25 years ago, Jeff Bezos was hand-packing books on the floor of his Seattle garage. Today, he’s operating a global powerhouse worth more than $1.5 trillion. Tomorrow, Amazon is poised to be the framework of our entire civilization - in fact, we’re already halfway there.

From Alexa to self-flying drones, colossal fulfillment centres, and its very own airline, Amazon’s collection of high-tech innovation continues to grow. But as more and more money is funneled into the company, and as thousands more of us become reliant on its services every single day, before we know it, we’ll be living in cities completely run by Amazon.

Would we be better or worse off for the technological revolution? Let’s see what an Amazon-run world would look like, and then you can decide that for yourself.

As human beings do, the people of Europe were very busy traveling around to trade, to spread religion, and in a lot of cases to try and conquer other people. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Europeans developed a bunch of tools and techniques that would allow them to travel around the world, in numbers and force heretofore unseen on the planet. And a lot of the results weren't great for the people who already lived in the places Europeans were ""visiting.""

STAY AWESOME GUYS! :D","A Covid-19 vaccine could take a long time. Some scientists are proposing a controversial plan that could get us one faster. 

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab​

With thousands of people dying of Covid-19 every day, the sooner a vaccine can be deemed safe and effective, the better. But vaccine development is a lengthy process that isn’t easy to rush, and that’s in part because of the final step in testing any vaccine: the phase III trial. Phase III requires tens of thousands of volunteers, each of whom get either a placebo or an experimental vaccine. The problem is the next part: Vaccine developers have to wait until a statistically significant number of them, going about their lives normally, eventually get naturally infected. This can take years.

To speed that up, some epidemiologists and scientists are calling for something called a human challenge trial, in which a subject who has been given the vaccine is deliberately infected. This isn’t a new concept; human challenge trials have been used to develop vaccines or treatments for lots of diseases, like cholera, typhoid, malaria, influenza, and common cold viruses. But what sets Covid-19 apart from those diseases is that it currently has no effective treatment. Because it’s so new, we also aren’t fully aware of its long-term health effects. Unlike other human challenge trials, a Covid-19 challenge trial would entail a risk of serious illness — and even death.

It’s because of those risks that a Covid-19 challenge trial would be limited to the young and healthy, who would be at the lowest risk of harm. But there are questions beyond the ethics. Would artificially infecting someone in a lab setting provide useful information on how to prevent natural infection? Would a study performed on only young and healthy people produce a vaccine that works for everyone? And with some vaccines already far along in their phase III trials, would a human challenge trial do any good at this point? 

Even though no Covid-19 human challenge trials are currently planned, more than 30,000 people from nearly 150 countries have already said they would volunteer for one if the opportunity presented itself. The question is, should we let them?

Note: The headline on this piece has been updated.
Previous headline: Would you volunteer to get Covid-19?

In which John announces the project he and Rosianna Halse Rojas have been working on, Life's Library. Here's the idea: Every six weeks for a year, a group of people read a book together, and discuss it on a discord channel. You can choose either a physical subscription--in which you get the book, a letter from me, bookplates made by artists we love, and other cool surprises--or a digital subscription--in which you pick up your own copy of the book and get all the other resources emailed to you. 100% of profits will go to Partners in Health. We don't yet know if there will be enough interest in this idea to make it work, so we aren't launching yet. But if you want to reserve your spot for if/when we do launch, you can sign up now at https://store.dftba.com/collections/l...​ by clicking on the subscription you want and entering your email address at the bottom of the page. 

Fans of An Absolutely Remarkable Thing: https://discord.gg/X97RQDu​

Let us know if you have any questions. Here's to reading great book together!

This video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2oscAe9​

I don't condone malicious hacking of gates, garages or other property. The point of this video was to discuss how it could be done using fairly basic technology like this toy that was originally intended as an instant messaging device. I learned a lot in making this video about how codes are sent and received, how they are encrypted or not encrypted. I found out how hard it is to execute in practice something which in principle doesn't seem that difficult.

One of the groups that came under assault was the European Jewish population. More than six million Jewish people were killed in a systematized genocide. Five million more people died in the same time frame as a result of Nazi persecution. In addition to the Jews, Roma people, homosexuals, political dissidents, Polish people, Slavic people, black people, and many other perceived enemies were imprisoned and killed by the regime.

--

Under her shrewd eye and pen, Sylvia Plath turned everyday objects into haunting images: a “new statue in a drafty museum,” a shadow in a mirror, a slab of soap. Her breathtaking perspectives and unflinching language made her a touchstone for readers seeking to break the silence around issues of trauma, frustration and sexuality. Iseult Gillespie shares why Plath's writing continues to captivate.

https://bit.ly/3rCFiam​
Artist, Producer, entrepreneur, and visionary Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901. That means, if he was still alive, he would have just celebrated his 119th birthday.

Walt might have died in 1966, but his memory lives on. He changed the world in so many ways and he certainly has left an impression on so many lives that grew up with the brand he created. Walt's life and time have always been a popular topic for conversation. In many ways, he exemplified what it means to achieve the American dream. 

He got his start as just a lower-class student from Chicago, Illinois, and wound up becoming one of the most influential individuals of the 20th century. His theme parks have become some of the most visited locations on the planet and the characters he played a part in creating have become universally known. 

But whenever someone becomes that famous, their high-profile image leads to countless rumors and myths that come out of the woodwork that in many ways disparage the individual's legacy. It doesn't even matter that much of this hearsay is completely unsubstantiated, the public tends to circulate misinformation long after such claims have been thoroughly debunked. 

In this video, we're going to get to the bottom of some of the most common myths and rumors about Walt Disney. Some of these you might even assume are facts, but that's the funny thing about history. As time goes on, the lines between fiction and reality begin to fade.

family friendly pg clean","Raya and the Last Dragon is a beautifully animated, action-packed hero's journey, and a great next evolution of Disney's modern-day princess films. Where recent Disney princess films reminded young girls they too could be heroes, Raya and the Last Dragon teaches its viewers about the perils of going at it alone. It's a smart next evolution of the action princess coming-of-age story, with a clear throughline to princess predecessors in Frozen and Moana.

The film features an outstanding voice cast, including Kelly Marie Tran, Awkwafina, Izaac Wang, Gemma Chan, Daniel Dae Kim, Benedict Wong, Jona Xiao, Sandra Oh, Thalia Tran, Lucille Soong, Alan Tudyk, Gordon Ip, Dichen Lachman,  Patti Harrison, Jon ""Dumbfoundead"" Park, Sung Kang,  Sierra Katow, Ross Butler, François Chau, and Paul Yen. Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada are directing, with Paul Briggs and John Ripa co-directing. Osnat Shurer and Peter Del Vecho are the producers, and Qui Nguyen and Adele Lim wrote the screenplay.

Walt Disney Animation Studios' Raya and the Last Dragon' will be available on Disney+ with Premier Access in most Disney+ markets, at the same time as it is released in select theaters on March 5, 2021.","Leave a LIKE if you enjoyed! :D

But that’s not all, as Sony has treated fans to a slew of new PSVR trailers! There’s something for all kinds of fans, with a VR remake of Doom 3, the VR MMO Zenith, and more. If taking on demons or MMO’s aren’t your thing you can get crafty with the survival game, Song in the Smoke, or the new virtual reality FPS, Fracked!

Join the Open Sourced Reporting Network: http://www.vox.com/opensourcednetwork​

You’ve seen the pop-ups: “This site uses cookies to improve your experience. Please accept cookies.”

Cookies do improve your experience. They function as the website’s short term memory; with each new click you make, cookies help the site identify you as the same person. Imagine every time you add something to your cart and click away, it disappears. Or each time you load a new page on Facebook, you have to log in again. Without cookies, the online world we know today couldn’t exist. 

But that world relies on advertising, which gives three kinds of companies a strong incentive to track your online behavior. Brands want to sell products by serving you ads for things you’re likely to buy. Platforms and publishers — like Vox — want to make money by serving those ads when you’re on their site. And middlemen are in the business of ensuring the ads from the brands are delivered to the right people. 

In this video, we explain how cookies work and what you should know about how they’re being used. And we get a little help from the man who invented them.

Open Sourced is a year-long reporting project from Recode by Vox that goes deep into the closed ecosystems of data, privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. Learn more at http://www.vox.com/opensourced​

We live in an America where television programs, commercials, and movies are trying to represent a browner country; where Despacito, a Spanish-language song, tops the Billboard charts and where NFL players kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality. We live in an America where politicians on the right and left appeal to voters, with explicit references to race.

And researchers are now able to pinpoint how these indirect and direct are shifting political ideology.

Brad Beardsley, Jasmin Brown, and Ken Brown join Ally for late night RuPaul & other 90s queer icons.","The fame and attention that come with celebrity status have their pros and cons - some serious, some silly, but all problematic. It's no secret celebrities have crazy schedules that leave no room for breaks between shoots, interviews, and public appearances. But even celebrities are humans with bodily functions, much like the rest of us. And a heavy breakfast or lunch will make them just as susceptible to breaking wind at the oddest of times. The only difference is that we may not have an audience or have just a couple of people around, while they may have several million watching them on TV, which definitely doesn't sound fun. 
 
While letting one rip can be super embarrassing for anyone, we figure doing so on a set with dozens of people around can be downright mortifying. What could be further worse is being live on TV, with millions of eyes watching - talk about a whole new level of humiliating. Cases of celebrities farting on-screen are rare but not unheard of, such as Eva Mendez, Ricky Gervais, Taylor Swift, and many others. Many celebrities laugh it off when caught, and why not, farting is as normal as any other bodily function.

Rap superstar Drake has his own private jet, but did you know that he got it completely for free? Aubrey Graham has an impressive net worth of $150 million, but he didn’t need to go shopping for private planes. Instead, the Canadian company Cargojet presented the rapper with a $185 million customized Boeing 767, complete with $100 million worth of renovations. Drizzy now calls his personal wings Air Drake and uses the plane to jet off to all sorts of places, from the Bahamas to Barbados and Turks and Caicos. As part of the deal with Cargojet, all he’s gotta do is post tons of pictures of himself using his private plane and make sure it’s noticed when it flies around the world. With a custom blue paint job featuring the OVO owl, the deal is definitely working out well for both sides. 

The inside of the plane is just as impressive, with gold-accents, a king sized bed, plush leather seating and tons of space for partying-- which Drake and his friends have definitely been doing. Drake even used his plane for a victory lap around Toronto after the Raptors won the NBA playoffs in 2019, because he knows how to celebrate a win in style. Since the rapper makes $2 million a night while on tour, his plane is both fun and useful, and he’s loaned it out to multiple friends when they’re in need of a quick ride home. Here’s everything you need to know about Air Drake.

Whenever the president ventures overseas or interstate, he takes a seat in his high-tech, impenetrable jumbo jet. Not only is it a means of transportation, but a mobile hideout for refuge when all ground positions seemed vulnerable to attack.

Transporting the president around the world is no easy task; as the world's most famous plane, Air Force One needs to be expertly fitted with unhackable security systems, ultimate luxury, and top-of-the-line missile defense - and mark our words, it is. 

Taking into account all of the fascinating, high-end military features, and the undeniable authoritative presence of Air Force One, it's no wonder the media has dubbed it the ""flying White House."" Let’s take a look inside then, shall we? Seatbelts on!

Water is refreshing, hydrating, and invaluable to your survival. But clean water remains a precious and often scarce commodity – there are nearly 800 million people who still don’t have regular access to it. Why is that? And how can you tell whether the water you have access to — whether from a tap or otherwise — is drinkable? Mia Nacamulli examines water contamination and treatment.

THANKS FOR WATCHING, LOVE YOU GUYS!
- FaZe Teeqo","16 year-old scientist and humanitarian Jack Andraka has already changed the world.  At 15, he won the Intel ISEF Gorden E. Moore award, the $75,000 top prize, for his invention of an early stage Pancreatic Cancer diagnostic test. Being referred to ""the 15 year-old who changed the course of medicine"" was not enough for Jack.

Jack has put together a team of teenagers from across the country and entered the $10 million Qualcomm Tricorder X PRIZE competition that will be judged and decided in the end of 2015.  The goal of the Tricorder X PRIZE competition is to create a device the size of a smart phone that can make reliable health diagnoses, which would be available directly to consumers at anytime, anywhere.

If you thought Jack's Pancreatic Cancer diagnostic test was a game changer, just wait until 2015 to see what his team unveils.  It will change your mind!

It looks like humans aren’t the only ones who need to worry about keeping off the pounds. The world is full of chubby creatures that have gotten way fatter than their species is even supposed to. From a squirrel that looks like a bowling ball to a giant bear that’s winning awards for being the fattest in a nature park, it looks like some animals just can’t lay off the snacks. 

You’ll never believe some of the lives these fat animals are living. There’s a rabbit that’s worth $1.6 million just for being overweight and a spider monkey who’s addicted to Italian food. But while some of these animals get fat on their own, overindulgent humans are definitely to blame for some of these overweight animals' eating habits-- like Oshine the Orangutan, whose owners let her eat marshmallows whenever she wants. From the fattest raccoon to the fattest big cat ever, here are 10 of the fattest animals in the world.

For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com","Oh My....you're in the description. So, the way I tended to deal with the question of free will in my earlier days was that I of course make decisions, it's just inevitable that I will make the decision I made. The fact that it was inevitable did not make it not a decision. The fact that it could be pre-determined what I would do with my free will did not mean I didn't have free will.

Of course, it did. To me that seems like a palliative. Now, instead, I just choose to not accept something that I know is true. I do the same thing with regard to universal meaning and my inevitable demise. And, honestly, there a trillion other truths I ignore every day, so I think it's OK.

I also recognize that the question of Free Will is far from settled among the philosophers and scientists and physicists and all of those people. This isn't a ""does free will exist"" video, it's a ""here's how I react to the fact that lots of people thing it doesn't"" video. And so, maybe this video shouldn't have been called intentionally ignorant maybe it should have been called ""I don't want to know!""

--

Whether or not you realize it, surfers are masters of complicated physics. The science of surfing begins as soon as a board first hits the water. Surfers may not be thinking about weather patterns in the Pacific, tectonic geology or fluid mechanics, but the art of catching the perfect wave relies on all these things and more. Nick Pizzo dives into the gnarly physics that make surfing possible.

https://bit.ly/3rCFiam​
Nicole Kidman and Javier Bardem are rumored to be playing Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in an upcoming biopic film. The film, which is tentatively titled Being the Ricardos, is written by Aaron Sorkin. He's also set to be sitting in the director's chair. The film is reportedly being produced by Amazon Studios and Escape Artists.

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...​ 

Sorkin is best known for writing acclaimed films like The Social Network, Steve Jobs, and Charlie Wilson's War. He made his directorial debut with 2017's Molly's Game - a Golden Globe nominated production which he also wrote. He followed that up with 2020s Netlfix exclusive The Trial Of The Chicago 7. Sorkin is also the writer, creator, and executive producer of the critically acclaimed NBC political drama The West Wing. 

Being the Ricardos is purportedly going to take place during one week of production of the sitcom I Love Lucy The movie will apparently start with a Monday table read-though. The rest of the film will chronicle Desi and Lucy's lives throughout the week leading up to the Friday night filming in front of a live studio audience. Of course, it's plot probably won't be as simple as it sounds. Considering Sorkin's modus operandi, Being The Ricardos will likely delve into a crucial crisis point in the couple's personal lives that will not only change their career paths but also their marriage.

Since then there have been numerous false starts and lofty promises while we were still no closer to having a car that with the push of a button could take to the air. All of that is changing, though...or so they say. A Japanese company has reached a little realized threshold of sustaining a manned flight on a multirotor electric vertical take off and landing flying car. While four minutes and a few feet doesn’t sound that impressive, it’s a lot closer than most have gotten in their hopes of designing a mode of transport that operates in three dimensions instead of just the boring old two. SkyDrive Inc’s SD-03 flying car concept joins Hyundai and Uber’s flying taxi as well as concepts from other startups and stalwarts like Boeing and AirBus trying to be first into what could end up being a trillion dollar industry. But are we really three years away from the flying car like Japan hopes, or are there more hurdles for the flying car before we can live our Jetson’s future? Let’s take a look at the Toyota invested SkyDrive SD-03 and what it might mean for the future of the flying car.

When Homer’s Iliad was first written down in the eighth century BCE, the story of the Trojan war was already an old one. From existing oral tradition, audiences knew the tales of the long siege, the duels outside the city walls, and the trick that finally won the war. In the end, the city was burned to the ground, never to rise again. But had it ever existed? Einav Zamir Dembin investigates.

--

In 1995, the British Medical Journal published a report about a builder who accidentally jumped onto a nail, which pierced straight through his steel-toed boot. He was in such agonizing pain that any movement was unbearable. But when the doctors took off his boot, they discovered that the nail had never touched his foot at all. What’s going on? Joshua W. Pate investigates the experience of pain.

Have you wondered about celebrities you didn’t know had died? When a major celebrity dies, their passing also becomes major news. Many of us feel a great sense of loss when our favorite stars pass away. While we may never have met them, they have impacted us with the work they’ve created.

Sadly, there are many great actors whose deaths seem to go under the radar. You might go years before you learned that some of your favorite entertainers have passed away.


These celebrities included the actor John Cazale who passed away from lung cancer in his forties. There was also the tragic loss of David Graf who was a regular in the hilarious and raucous Police Academy films.


Happy Days actress Erin Moran passed away in 2017 after a long battle with cancer. She had a tough adult life, but we remember her for entertaining us as a teenager on the classic sitcom.


What about Diff’rent Strokes actress Dana Plato who died at the tender age of 34? After performing in the classic 1970s sitcom, she wasn’t able to find decent work and struggled with substance abuse for much of her adult life.


Who can forget about James Avery who played Uncle Phil on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air? His passing was one of the saddest of recent times. The same goes for the legendary actress Marcia Wallace!


Unfortunately, many of our most beloved actors and actresses leave us too early and without us knowing about it. Many of them have brought us joy with their work and we should remember them not for their tragic deaths, but their fruitful lives. From their deaths, we can learn to live our lives to the fullest!


Watch this video to learn more about some tragic celebrity deaths that you may not have known about.

We’re all human and we all make mistakes. But these unforgettable errors - and we mean that in the bad way - are an entire level of their own.

Imagine losing billions of dollars just because of a silly typo. Or going bankrupt and threatening the livelihood of entire cities because you forgot to read the instructions properly. It sounds absurd but it's far from fantasy - events like these have actually happened.

From oil spills in Alaska to sunken ships in the Atlantic, forgotten space craft and neglected airports, the fascinating mistakes you’re about to see represent some of the most expensive blunders in human history.

Nobody has to tell you that 2020 was a difficult year for many people. It's quite evident that it was a year that many people would rather forget happened. For some, however, it was the last year that they were with us on this blue planet. Not only did the world lose so many people to the horrible reality that is COVID-19 but we also lost quite a few celebrities that helped mold our culture.

This video is meant to pay tribute to the television actors, hosts, directors, and producers that we lost in 2020. Not only did we lose people like Alex Trebek, Carl Reiner, and James Lipton but there are literally dozens of others that won't be with us to bring in the New Year. So let's pay our respects to those that passed away during what was already a challenging and trying year.

Human-AI teams allow us to fill in each others weaknesses leveraging human creativity and insight with the ability to perform rote manual tasks and synthesize lots of information. This kind of collaboration can help us make better decisions, brainstorm new inventions, give us superhuman abilities, rescue victims of natural disasters, and of course become the ultimate chess master.

Pet taxidermy video [kind of gross]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl...​","Mac Davis was a country music star and songwriter for the greats that saw his career come to a commercial peak in the mid-1970s. He was one of the world's most popular performers back in his day. He was born in Lubbock, Texas on January 21, 1942, to a lower-income family. His father was a religious zealot and his mother left to go make a life for herself in Atlanta, Georgia. 
 
After Davis graduated from Lubbock High School at the age of 16, he moved to Atlanta to go live with his mother. He soon found himself with a promising career in the music industry as a regional manager for the Chicago based label Vee Jay. 
 
He joined Liberty records a few years later and made the move to LA, where he began writing songs for Kenny Rogers, Bobby Goldsboro, and Elvis Presley. 
 
It was working with the latter legend that earned his work a spot on the Top 40 charts with the Presley song 'Memories'. Following several more chart-topping writing credits, he began recording his own solo material which was also met with commercial success and critical acclaim. 
 
'Baby. Don't Get Hooked on Me', released in 1972 was his only number one hit and it also reached the top 20 on the country charts. He continued a career in country music before finding his way onto the television screen where he managed to land his own show The Mac Davis Show before making the jump to the big screen where he starred in almost two dozen films. 
 
In recent years he has been a frequent collaborator for big-name acts such as Avicii, Rivers Cuomo, Bruno Mars, and Keith Urban. 
 
On Septemeber 29, 2020, Mac Davis died from complications of arising after open-heart surgery. He left behind his three children and wife Lise Gerard. Although he may be gone, he will never be forgotten.

Bioware’s latest game will remain live for the time being, but no further work will be done on the project. CD Projekt Red recently updated fans with news of a delay for the next major patch, in light of the recent cyber attacks on the studio. Patch 1.2 is promised to be substantial with quality of life and performance fixes, but we’ll be seeing it a bit later than anticipated as CDPR has been busy buffing its security and IT infrastructure. And finally, Sydnee’s got a short preview of what the super-couple have been up to since the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths on the CW’s Superman and Lois.

STAY AWESOME TEAMMORGZ!! :D","So we’ve learned a lot of strategies to fight off failure. But we could be doing all this right and still fail if we straight-up run out of money. 

Expenses can pop-up, supplies can suddenly be hard to find, or delivering the most value to customers can involve some expensive choices. Businesses can run out of money -- it happens. But it doesn’t have to happen to us.

No matter how we make electricity, it takes up space. Coal requires mines, and plants to convert it into electricity. Nuclear power takes uranium mines, facilities to refine it, a reactor, and a place to store the spent fuel safely. Renewable energy needs wind turbines or solar panels. So how much space would it take to power the whole world? Explore the sustainability of different power sources.

Working as a miner has never been a safe job. In fact, it's probably one of the most dangerous professions that someone can pursue. Granted, that doesn't stop anyone from seeking the riches that are found deep below the surface of the Earth.

Discovery Channel's Gold Rush franchise documents multiple teams of gold miners in their search for the precious metal. You would think that with the aid of a full-on television production crew mining wouldn't be nearly as dangerous but sadly three people have died on the set of Gold Rush over the years. 

In this video, we're going to take a closer look at those that have perished while producing the popular reality series. You might be surprised to learn that none of the men mentioned in this video died because of a mining accident. In fact, just the opposite. Two of these hard-working miners died from fairly typical causes but one of their deaths has created a lot of buzz and mystery.

We got a pretty crazy story for you in today’s video, and it’s one that we’re sure will make you take a look in any old garage that some of your family members might have on their property.  See, what if we told you a car was found in an old run down garage deep in a forest of Southwest Germany… would you expect it to be… a sports car?  And not just any sports car… One that was featured in none other than the 1969 film starring Michael Cane (Yes, Alfred from the Christopher Nolan Batman Movies!)... One of the most high end sports cars on the planet?  ...a vintage 1969 P400 S model Lamborghini Miura?  Well, it was. And it’s one of the last remaining examples of this car in its original condition, which also happens to make it one of the rarest cars on the planet.  That’s probably why when it went to auction, it sold for a colossal 1.2 million pounds.  Yeah.  This car is no joke, folks.  So… what’s the story here?  Why is such a rare Lamborghini sitting in some old garage?  Does it even still work?  And… how much did it go for when it was auctioned off?  We got all your answers right here.  Don’t you dare drive off, cause we’re sure that you’re gonna want to know all the ins and outs and everything that is in between about this super car that can only be afforded by, The Richest.

AS ALWAYS KEEP IT REAL (⌐■_■)","I feel like this video could have easily been adapted into a medium-length non-fiction book. As soon as I start talking about identity, and story, and how we determine who we are, I basically can keep going forever. So I hope this wasn't too much, but also didn't leave so much out that it feels empty and vacuous and useless or, worse, dangerously simplistic.

Particularly simplified is the idea that ""caring what other people think about you"" prevents you from being ""really bad."" I don't actually know if that's true. But I think that caring what other people think about you is, like, maybe the only thing that gives society and culture enough cohesion to operate productively.

Mike Rowe is known to television audiences as the host of several shows that aired on the Discovery Channel network throughout the 2000s and 2010s. These shows include hits such as Deadliest Catch and Shark Week. However, no show has achieved quite as much popularity as his passion project, Dirty Jobs.

https://www.youtube.com/factsverse?su...​

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...​ 

Rowe initially conceived Dirty Jobs as a series of individual seven minute segments that he pictured airing on Good Morning America. His original name for the show in pitches was Somebody's Gotta Do It. He brought this name back in 2013 when the Dirty Jobs concept was rebranded to the CNN network for three seasons after an eight season run on the the Discovery Channel network. The show provided an inside look into some of the dirtiest jobs in the world, including jobs in the livestock and sanitation fields. Rowe was always featured getting right up into the action with the workers. 

In Dirty Jobs, Mike Rowe won the audience over with his unique looks into industries that the audience might not normally be privy too. As well, audiences took a liking to Mike Rowe's good sense of humor. Rowe was not above partaking in gross-out gags to win over the audience, and always approached even the dirtiest job with a good nature. Now, it looks like Mike Rowe is looking to bring over his charm to a new area of interest. 

Along with dirty jobs, Mike Rowe has always had a passion for history. His grandfather was a skilled laborer, but his father was a high school history teacher. So while Dirty Jobs paid tribute to Rowe's grandfather, this new program will pay tribute to his father. The show will be spun off from Rowe's podcast, The Way I Heard It with Mike Rowe. On the podcast, Rowe goes over topics from history, reciting the information ""the way he has heard it"". Rowe will bring this same concept to the Discovery+ network on his new show, which will be called Six Degrees with Mike Rowe. 

The name comes from the concept that there are only six degrees of separation between two things, including topics throughout history. Through this concept, Mike looks to instill a deeper personal connection with history into the television audience. According to him, this is a way that he can help bring people together with history instead of tearing them apart. Mike feels that if more people knew about the past, they may be less likely to repeat it's tragedies in the future.  

Along with Mike's new show on the Discovery+ streaming platform, Dirty Jobs has also been revived in the form of a new spin-off on the Discovery Channel network proper. This spin-off, titled Dirty Jobs: Rowe'd Trip after the host himself, will feature him tackling plenty more dirty jobs from his own unique perspective. Between this spin-off and Six Degrees with Mike Rowe, this is one television host that certainly seems keen on providing unique and enlightening programming. Sit tight with Facts Verse as Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs is back with a new show!

Read more on the Syria strikes from Vox's defense and foreign writer Alex Ward: http://bit.ly/2JRFbmv​

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

President Donald Trump’s limited strike on Syria in April is an established tactic among presidents — his predecessors from Obama through Reagan all used similar actions, with varying results.

But limited strikes that accomplish all their goals are exceedingly rare — only about 6 percent can make that claim, according to research by expert Micah Zenko. Most strikes have mixed success, at best. 

For example: Trump’s justification for attacking Syria was to send a message about Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons. That’s the same justification he used when authorizing a limited strike on Syria one year earlier. 

Why do presidents even use limited strikes if they’re rarely effective? There is some logic to it. For one, they’re not very costly. But more importantly, these strikes generally don’t put US troops in harm's way. And well, politically, presidents have very little to lose by exercising the option. 

In fact, authorizing a limited strike can give the appearance of strength and decisiveness and can sometimes have a positive effect on approval, whether or not the strike actually achieves its intended goals.

The My Three Sons cast, led by Fred MacMurray as Steve Douglas, is a beloved sitcom that ran for 12 great years. In this video, we're taking a look at the My Three Sons cast then and now to see how they've changed through the years.

The series originally featured William Frawley (who had first co-starred with Fred MacMurray 25 years earlier in the movie Car 99) as the boys' live-in maternal grandfather and housekeeper, William Michael Francis ""Bub"" O'Casey. William Demarest, playing Bub's brother, ""Uncle Charley,"" replaced Frawley in 1965 because of Frawley's illness. In September 1965 (when the show moved from ABC to CBS and when it began being filmed in color), eldest son Mike (Tim Considine) married fiancée Sally Ann Morrison (Meredith MacRae), and his character was written out of the show. To keep the emphasis on ""three sons"", original youngest son Chip's (Stanley Livingston) friend Ernie (Barry Livingston) was adopted. In the program's later years, Steven Douglas remarried and adopted his new wife's young daughter Dorothy Anne (""Dodie"") (Dawn Lyn).

While the three sons were always central to the storyline, several major changes took place by the late 1960s. In the spring of 1967, the ratings for the series began to sag and My Three Sons finished its seventh season in 31st place in the Nielsen ratings. It was decided that the 1967–1968 season would bring the program not only a new time slot but also new storylines to spice up the ratings. In the fall of 1967, CBS moved My Three Sons to Saturday at 8:30 pm ET. In the season premiere episode, ""Moving Day"", the Douglas family and Uncle Charley relocate from the fictional town of Bryant Park in the Midwest to Los Angeles. Robbie (Don Grady) marries his classmate/girlfriend, Katie Miller (Tina Cole). Tina Cole, in fact, had appeared in different roles on three previous episodes of My Three Sons: ""House For Sale"" from the fourth season (February 13, 1964), ""The Coffee House Set"" from the fifth season (November 19, 1964) and ""Robbie and the Little Stranger"" from the sixth season (February 17, 1966). At the end of the 1967–1968 season, the ratings had improved from the previous year with the series placing at 24th in the Nielsens. The following season, the newlyweds discover that Katie is pregnant and she gives birth to triplets named Robert, Steven, and Charles. Originally played by sets of uncredited twins, these babies were later played uncredited by Guy, Gunnar and Garth Swanson. The most familiar triplets in the show's last two seasons are played by Michael, Daniel and Joseph Todd.

For the series' 12th (and ultimately, final) season, CBS moved My Three Sons to Mondays at 10:00 pm ET. In addition to the time changes for the 12th season, a new four part story arc is introduced with MacMurray in a second role, that of his cousin, the Laird (Lord) Fergus McBain Douglas of Sithian Bridge. English actor Alan Caillou's voice was dubbed over MacMurray's. The plot centers on Lord Douglas's arrival in Los Angeles from the family's native Scotland, in search of a woman to marry and return with him to Scotland.

The series' cast had several music connections. MacMurray began his career as a saxophone player during the 1930s, and sometimes played it on the series, as well as clarinet. Frawley had been a vaudeville actor and sang in the 1929 short film Fancy That as well as in the 1936 film The General Died at Dawn and in several episodes of I Love Lucy. Actress Tina Cole (Katie) was born into the King Family, a popular 1950s–1960s group. Ronne Troup (Polly) was the step-daughter of singer Julie London and daughter of musician/composer Bobby Troup (who wrote the song Route 66 and also starred in the TV program Emergency! along with wife London), and Dawn Lyn is the younger sister of 1970s pop idol Leif Garrett. Don Grady (Robbie) composed and produced music, having created successful Las Vegas venues for Phantom of the Opera star Michael Crawford and pop star David Cassidy.","The European Space Agency designed a mini, 3D-printed replica of the ExoMars rover, which anyone with a 3D printer can make.

In the 1600s, the Dutch East India Company employed hundreds of ships to trade goods around the globe. In order to fund their voyages, the company turned to private citizens to invest money to support trips in exchange for a share of the profits. In doing so, they unknowingly invented the world’s first stock market. So how do companies and investors use the market today? Oliver Elfenbaum explains.

CBS's Gilligan's Island was a rare production that managed to stay with audiences well beyond its time, and Dawn Wells was one jewel that shone brightly in the 60s sitcom. The actor, who portrayed Mary Anne Summers on the show, defined a character that was so new yet so old - charming, guileless, and hopeful packaged into a young beauty.

While Wells was a common name in the theatre scene, with more than 100 productions under her belt, her career on the small and big screens didn't take off quite as well. And although she performed in a number of projects, the actor is best recognized as Mary Anne. 

Gilligan's Island lasted only three seasons, but the show and the cast remained famous for a long time to come. Even though the sitcom was well-received during the original release, it seems audiences realized what a rare find it was mostly during the reruns. It's been more than 5o years since Gilligan's Island was first broadcast on TV, and yet, many can remember the characters or even a few episodes. 

On December 30, 2020, Dawn Wells died of COVID-19 related causes at the age of 82, leaving co-stars, friends, and fans grieving. In this video, we're looking back on Wells' life and career and what other celebrities had to say about this star of the yesteryears.

We’ve covered everything on this channel from the most wild homes owned by celebrities, to some of the most impressive palaces owned by royalty, to the mansions that house politicians, and even some of the most beautiful abandoned residences that will leave your jaw dropped right on the floor.  But today, we have something really special.  It’s been in construction for eight years, and it is finally on the market.  And believe it or not, it has garnered the nickname, The One.  Yes, that’s right, the same name that Neo from The Matrix starts using after he learns the truth about the world is the name of a brand new home located in sunny LA.  But we have to say, after you learn a bit about just what went into this mansion’s construct, and what you’ll find on the inside, you’ll have to agree, this place really does deserve it’s ominous nickname.  Right off the bat, we can tell you that The One is the most expensive home ever constructed, and it also happens to be the largest.  And due to a recent ordinance in Los Angeles, it also will truly be the only home of it’s kind in the area.  We can’t stress it enough, this place really truly is one of a kind.  So, ready to take a look inside?  We got you.  Come with us as we take you on a quick trip through the construction of The One, and what you will find on the inside now that it’s completed.

Don't you often wonder what is in a name? Our answer to that would be: well, to a celebrity, everything is about his/her name. While some of them prefer using the name given to them at birth, many tend to opt for a more memorable or a catchier moniker. In this video, we are going to take you through some of the names of classic TV actors which were same as that of other notable people. Some of these celebrities share the same name with the modern artists while others shared names with those from over centuries past.","Explore how fiber optics uses light to transmit data over long distances, and with integrated photonics, expands our virtual world beyond the internet.

In 2012, a team of researchers set a world record, transmitting 1 petabit of data— that’s 10,000 hours of high-def video— over a fifty-kilometer cable, in a second. This wasn’t just any cable. It was a souped-up version of fiber optics, the hidden network that links our planet and makes the internet possible. What is fiber optics and how does it work?

At the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics, Mirai Nagasu became the first American woman to land a triple axel in an Olympic event, just the third woman ever to accomplish this feat. She failed to cleanly land the same jump at the 2018 US Figure Skating Championship, in San Jose California, but she still received 6.07 points for the jump, almost two points more than her teammate's perfect double axel, which received 4.09 points. Figure skating score is complicated, and the new scoring system has changed how competitors skate. But how does it work?

The women of the Bond films are one of the most iconic features of the franchise. Sure, some of their names and roles are saturated in antiquated sexism but they are still iconic components of pop culture that are worth taking note of.

Granted everything changes. Bond girls today are far more self-sufficient than they damsels in distress of yesteryear, but not all of 007s bed-mates were as helpless or innocent as they seemed. Bond girls have taken many forms over the years. Some have been unexpectedly evenly matched with our protagonist while others have been cold-blooded Femme Fatales. 

In this video, we're going to look at 10 of the best Bond girls from the franchise. What makes a Bond girl memorable? Who are the stand-outs? There have been dozens but only a few stick out from the rest and dare we say, some are totally forgettable. Not these lovely ladies. Only the best Bond babes have made their way into this video. 

The Top 10 Bond Girls Ranked","Read and be inspired by the 2017 Gates Letter: https://www.gatesnotes.com/2017-Annua...​
 In which John discusses the annual letter from Melinda and Bill Gates, and how it shows that the world is getting dramatically better. Since I was your (average) age, global poverty has dropped from 30% to under 10%. Child mortality has been cut nearly in half. And by the time the average vlogbrothers viewer is my age, absolute poverty and child mortality should both be extremely rare everywhere on Earth.

There is a lot of bad news. It is real. It is important. But it's also important to take a step back and look at the human story over time, and each year the Gates letter offers us that opportunity.

SOURCES:

Our World in Data is an amazing resource for understanding changes over time in the human condition, from literacy rates to life expectancy. Their overview of the child mortality situation is excellent: https://ourworldindata.org/child-mort...​ as is their introduction to absolute poverty rates: https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-po...​

The In a Nutshell video I reference (which was made with Our World in Data, incidentally) can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5...​

The 2014 Gates letter pretty well destroyed the argument that foreign aid doesn't work: http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We...​ (It's true that much of the foreign aid during the Cold War was often minimally effective at reducing poverty and improving health, but it wasn't really DESIGNED to do either; it was designed to sway governments toward capitalism or communism. Foreign aid since 1990 has been been better targeted, especially when it comes to health care. There is a longer and more academic overview of the research here: https://www.oecd.org/dev/34353462.pdf​

Less than 1% of the U.S. federal government's budget goes to foreign aid: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/w...​ (...unless you count defense aid, then it is like 1.2%)

One thing I didn't hit on in this video is that there are some experts that argue that the world has experienced greater peace and prosperity because of nuclear weapons and that they have done more good than harm. That's a commonly held viewpoint...that the threat of nuclear weapons has prevented major powers from going to war with each other. This has maybe increased the rate of proxy wars, which has been bad for the Middle East, some of Africa, and a particular Asian Peninsula, but it's better, they say, than World War III. 

What I want to remember, however, is that this isn't just something that was inevitable...so thank you to everyone who worked to create this more stable world. I hope we can maintain it.

Huge thanks to Dr. Stephen Steiner and the crew at Aerogel Technologies. To find out more or buy your own aerogel sample, check out: http://www.aerogeltechnologies.com/​

Thanks to Dr. Steven Jones and Dr. Mihail Petkov at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory

And thanks to FLIR for loaning us the awesome high definition thermal camera. The footage is amazing! https://www.flir.com​

Aerogel’s extraordinary properties are due in large part to its structure. Aerogel is a solid but on the nanoscale it has a mesh or sponge-like structure. The struts of this structure are nanoscale, as are the pores at around 20nm across. This makes silica aerogel incredibly light (it was once the lightest solid but has now been superseded by graphene aerogel), transparent and adsorbent. 

An ice-cube sized piece of aerogel has an internal surface area roughly equal to half a football field. Aerogel is used in high end museum cases to regulate humidity. Plus it helps maintain the vacuum on the Mars Insight seismometers - it adsorbs moisture and other outgassed volatiles that come from the spacecraft itself. Proposed uses include as a physical insecticide by ‘drying out insects’ reducing the need for chemical and toxic pesticides.

Music by Kevin Mcleod (http://incompetech.com):​ Pale Rider & The Cannery","Coratoan was the only word carved in to a tree, after an entire village had disappeared fro the island of Roanoke, USA. Centuries later, we've finally discovered what happened to them. 

Subscribe for more amazing videos! ► http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest​ ◄


The lost village of Roanoke had been dubbed one of America’s oldest and greatest mysteries, with more questions raised than answers. More than 100 people were dropped off on the island, but three years later, they’d vanished into thin air.

Few mysteries are as perplexing and intriguing as this one. In most situations, clues can point you in the right direction, but in the case of Roanoke, the items left behind on the island - rifles, carvings, and farming tools - only made finding the lost settlers ever more difficult.

What happened to them? Were they captured? Did the sail away back to England? Were they integrated into other tribes? These, and many more theories have floated around as time passed. However, there’s one particular line of thought that is now widely understood as the most logical explanation behind their sudden evaporation.

There are over 2400 species of saturniid moths and each of them have this same life cycle. They stuff themselves with food during their caterpillar stage and then use their adult, flying stage only as a way to find a mate for the next generation.

--

On the edge of the vast Sahara desert, citizens snuck out of the city of Timbuktu and took to the wilderness. They buried chests in the desert sand, hid them in caves, and sealed them in secret rooms. Inside these chests was a treasure more valuable than gold: the city’s ancient books. Why were they hiding these priceless manuscripts? Elizabeth Cox digs into the literary tradition of Timbuktu.

They didn’t invent the electric car, they just managed to find a way to make the long suffering alternative fuel vehicle a viable alternative. Since the first Tesla Roadster, Tesla has gone from “this will never work” to “can anyone beat them?” Well, as Tesla gets ready to take on the popular pickup category there are a dozen companies hoping to head Tesla off at the pass. Big names like Ford and Chevrolet join startups like Rivian and Lordstown in the rush for a battery powered workhorse. The future is bright enough for both of those brands that Ford and Chevrolet have invested in them to make sure the long standing brands aren’t left standing when the pickup world goes electric. Even old companies are reimagining themselves as an electric pickup brand, like conspicuous consumption flagship Hummer. There are already victims in the electric pickup wars with Workhorse giving up on their retail vehicle while they focus on wholesale fleet trucks. Or companies like Hercules Alpha, which is either the most Freudian truck company ever or an electric pickup pipe dream that could leave investors holding the bag. There’s even a way to make old things new again by using Bollinger skateboards to build new electric trucks out of old pickup bodies, or a pair of companies that will Tesla up your old Land Rover Discoverys. Let’s take a look at who is lining up to take the electric pickup throne from Tesla and who might have the goods.

After being marooned on a deserted and uncharted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, the five passenger's and two crew members of that S.S. Minnow had to learn to learn together while trying to find some way off the island. Of course, that was no easy task, and seeing as the show was designed to be a comedy, hijinks and shenanigans ensue. 

Gilligan's Island first aired In 1964 and audiences immediately took a liking to the quirky cast lead by Bob Denver as Gilligan and Alan Hale Jr. as the Skipper. The series stayed on the air for 4 seasons and enjoyed a lively fan base, but that wasn't enough to keep it going. 

There is a lot that you probably don't know about Gilligan's Island. For one thing, you probably completely missed the political and philosophical undertones tucked away below the series comedic script. We'll share this tidbit of information and much more in this revealing video that is sure to change the way you look at Gilligan's Island.

Full House first hit televisions in 1987, at which time we were introduced to the lovable Full House cast and their unique family dynamic. Since then, the actors from Full House have grown a lot and developed very different careers. In this video, we're looking at the Full House cast then and now to see how they've changed from 1987 to 2020.

00:00​ - Intro
0:15​ - Bob Saget as Danny Tanner
1:19​ - Candace Cameron Bure as D.J. Tanner
2:23​ - Jodie Sweetin as Stephanie Tanner
3:27​ - Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen as Michelle Tanner
4:31​ - Dave Coulier as Joey Gladstone
5:36​ - John Stamos as Uncle Jesse Katsopolis
6:41​ - Andrea Barber as Kimmy Gibbler
7:46​ - Lori Loughlin as Rebecca (Becky) Katsopolis

If you're familiar with the Full House cast, you're probably aware that many of them are still acting and very much in the public eye. However, not all of their careers went as expected.

Bob Saget, the comedian and actor who played Danny Tanner, probably had the most traditional career of the Full House cast. Although Full House was definitely a highlight, Bob Saget continued to be a successful comedian for many years after the show. He even took over America's Funniest Home Videos for a short while. Today, he continues to portray Danny Tanner on Netflix's Fuller House. Most recently, he was on the Masked Singer as ""Squiggly Monster"".

Candace Cameron Bure played D.J. Tanner, who seemed to grow up throughout the Full House series. Today, she is a beautiful woman who takes pride in her Christian beliefs and continues to act on screen. She temporarily reprised her role as D.J. Tanner in Netflix's Fuller House.

Jodie Sweetin played the sassy Stephanie Tanner, the middle sister of the bunch. After Full House ended, Sweetin opened up about having substance abuse issues, which is likely the reason she stayed out of the spotlight for most of her career. However, with an appearance on Dancing with the Stars, and a return for Fuller House, she clearly stays busy, and we enjoy watching her to this day.

Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are somewhat controversial acting twins who both played the role of Michelle Tanner, the baby sister. These two were acting from a very young age, and definitely owe a lot of their success to Full House. After the show, however, they continued acting in a variety of movies and shows as their stardom grew. In recent years, the Olsen twins have given up acting to instead focus on the world of fashion.

Dave Coulier played the goofy Joey Gladstone. He shares a lot of commonalities with his character, as he is a television actor, voice actor and comedian. In fact, he's even a private pilot on top of that, a trait that was also given to Joey Gladstone. Full House, and its sequel Fuller House, were the most successful points of Coulier's career, but he's stayed busy as an actor and comedian throughout the years nonetheless.

John Stamos played Uncle Jesse, or Jesse Katsopolis. His charm was no doubt one of his iconic traits during Full House, and it's a quality that's continued to identify him over the years. Today, John Stamos is as handsome as ever and continues to beef up his resume with a variety of dramatic and comedic roles.

Andrea Barber played Kimmy Gibbler, the seemingly honorary family member of the Full House cast. Her career seemed to flatline after Full House, but she returned to the screen as Kimmy Gibbler for the Netflix reboot Fuller House. Although her career was not quite as exciting, she's still a highly accomplished actress.

Lori Loughlin played Rebecca Donaldson, also called Becky, who later married John Stamos' character Uncle Jesse. She had a handful of roles after Full House, including a role in Fuller House, but none of these roles seemed to outshine her original appearance as Becky. Surprisingly, Lori Loughlin got caught up in a college admissions scandal in recent years, for which she is currently serving a 2-month prison sentence. Only time will tell how her career will change after she gets back out into the world!

Jane Seymour is an actress who has managed to maintain a pretty impressive career over the five decades since she first made her mark on the screen. From her initial big roles as a Bond girl in 1973's Live and Let Die to more recent turns in blockbuster films such as 2020's The War with Grandpa alongside Robert De Niro, Seymour has rarely been wanting for work. However, her most iconic role will likely always be her groundbreaking turn as the title character in the 1993 television period drama Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.

Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman would air for five years, from 1993 to 1998. During that period, Seymour would become the highest-paid actress on television for a short period of time. After a career spanning over two decades, the actress was more popular and successful than ever before. She would continue to find success over the years after the show ended, taking smaller roles in other television programs and some feature films. However, despite the success that Seymour would find with her career, she had some problems with her love life. 

On top of tackling numerous acting roles through her career, Jane Seymour has also tackled numerous marriages. The actress has been married and divorced four separate times. However, she maintains little bitterness over these past romances, always maintaing a positive outlook for everything that the future holds. This is perhaps one of the reasons that the actress still appears as vibrant and youthful as ever, even going on 70 years of age. 

Through all these marriages, Seymour still maintains healthy relationships with all involved. This includes when it comes times to co-parent her four children, as well as spending time with her grandchildren. Family will always come first to Seymour, but that doesn't mean she doesn't have time to maintain her career and show off her good looks. The actress has appeared in Playboy magazine a total of three times, the first time in 1973 and the most recent time in 2018. This is made even more notable when you consider that the actress was 67 years of age in 2018, yet still looked as beautiful as ever! She continues to thrive not only in her acting career, but on the dating scene. Since her last divorce in 2015, she has been seen dating once again with English filmmaker David Green. 

After an expansive career in film and television and four separate divorces, one may imagine that the stress has gotten to Jane Seymour. However, her attitude is just as positive as ever, and this positive attitude transfers over into her youthful charm! Nothing seems to be able to weigh this actress down. It appears as if her best years are still ahead of her, even after enough love and success for several life times. Join Facts Verse as we take a look at why Jane Seymour is in her prime - but 4 men divorced her.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

On April 7, 2020, as the coronavirus held much of the US under lockdown, the state of Wisconsin held an election. Many other states had already decided to delay their spring elections to protect voters. But in Wisconsin, voters were forced to choose between participating in the election, and their own safety. Wisconsin's decision sparked outrage, but it also highlighted a question that the US really needs to figure out soon: How do you hold an election during a pandemic?

Fortunately, there's actually a simple solution to this one: voting by mail. Tens of millions of Americans already vote this way, and if the rest of the US can prepare their election systems in time for the November election, they could avoid Wisconsin's fate. But time's running out.

--

Asgard, a realm of wonders, was where the Norse Gods made their home. There Odin’s great hall of Valhalla towered above the mountains and Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, anchored itself. Though their domain was magnificent, it stood undefended from the giants and trolls who sought to destroy them. But a stranger appeared and made the gods an offer. Alex Gendler details the myth of the master builder.

Thanks to some lucrative deals and wealthy marriages, these families have created some of the strongest and richest billionaire empires in the entire world. You might know Kate Mara and Rooney Mara thanks to their starring roles in “The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo” or “House of Cards”, but did you know that the Rooney family and the Mara family each own sports empires? Yup, the New York Giants and the Pittsburgh Steelers. And what about the Trump family-- their wealth started with Donald Trump’s grandfather and has resulted in Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka, marrying real-estate heir Jared Kushner and bringing their combined fortune to over a billion dollars. Plenty more family unions have built upon strong empires, like actress Salma Hayek marrying Francois-Henri Pinault, who owns Kering, one of France’s most successful companies. Together, they’re worth about $40 billion and are responsible for some of the world’s highest-fashion brands, like Gucci and Alexander McQueen. 

There’s also the Ambani family, who are India’s richest and built themselves a $1 billion home in a skyscraper. Mukesh Ambani’s daughter, Isha, married Anand Piramal in a $100 million ceremony and brought their combined family’s wealth to over $70 billion. And we can’t forget about one of America’s most famous families that’s worth well over a billion dollars combined-- the Kardashian-Jenner-West family.

Just when you thought Elon Musk couldn’t get any more ambitious, he spent $90 million firing a CONVERTIBLE into the dark depths of outer space.

That’s no joke, people. Merely a couple years after launching the Space X Falcon rocket, its shuttle has officially come within striking distance of our neighboring red planet. But this isn't your average space shuttle — in typical quirky Elon Musk fashion, Space X launched an astronaut strapped into a bright red Tesla Roadster, and the dynamic duo has been sailing through the Milky Way ever since. 

While SpaceX noted that the pair successfully achieved their ""first close approach"" with Mars in 2020, it’s expected to simply be the first of many. Spaceman is expected to get even closer in the future — the bright red (although rapidly fading) Tesla will pass by at a much, much closer 1.4 million mile distance on April 22, 2035, if all goes to plan, and thereafter, it should make its way back to Earth in 2047. This, of course, assumes that it doesn’t collide with Venus on the way, a small but real possibility. 

So, will this astronaut, known as Starman, ever actually land on Mars? And why’s he flying around there solo in the first place? Strap yourselves in and let’s find out.

But just because information is new, or algorithmically determined to be most relevant to you, doesn't necessarily mean it's the best or most accurate. So today we're going to teach you some tips to exercise a little more click restraint on the Internet.

The 22-year-old also talked about what it was like getting ready for the big day and how she felt becoming the youngest inaugural poet in U.S. history.

To better understand whether a reaction actually will happen, and how useful that reaction is, we need to understand thermodynamics and kinetics. In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we’ll review some important concepts from general chemistry, learn how to draw energy diagrams, go over the difference between an intermediate and a transition state, and get an introduction to catalysts.

There are two ways you could assess the deadliness of a crisis like the novel coronavirus pandemic. One is to ask, “How many people are dying?” And the other is to ask, “What is the risk of dying if you contract the virus?” For months, public health officials were unable to fully answer either of those questions.

Now, with death certificates and antibody-survey data coming in, we’re slowly getting a better picture of Covid-19 mortality. As we explain in this video, that picture is of a disease that’s killing more people than we knew, but a lower percentage of those infected. Most places are looking at a higher death count and lower death rate than previously reported.

But the biggest challenge in assessing a tragedy like this is that we’re still inside it — and nobody can predict how many lives will be lost before it ends.

Millions of Americans across the country have lost their jobs. But whether or not those people can get the unemployment benefits they deserve actually depends on where they live. In some states, more than two thirds of jobless people typically collect unemployment benefits. But in others, like Florida, fewer than one in 10 unemployed people get those benefits.

That massive difference has often been blamed on technology; Florida’s unemployment system is notoriously difficult to use. But technology doesn’t build itself. The real explanation requires a look at the ideology of the people who did.

#ABCNLPrime​ #Guatemala​ #Migrants​ #Poverty​ #Violence​ #USBorder​","Old-school Nerdfighter and writer and activist and policy strategist (and former campaign manager for Julian Castro), Maya Rupert, took the time to talk with me about police brutality toward Black people, how she's feeling, how privilege works, and what we should be doing right now and also forever.

So You Want to Talk About Race: https://bookshop.org/books/so-you-wan...​

This video originally had a section pointing people to the work of 8cantwait.org, but that has since been removed. Ultimately, much of this conversation moved beyond their suggestions and some questions have been raised about how significantly their suggestions would reduce police violence. We're no saying 8cantwait.org is necessarily bad, but that we didn't feel wholeheartedly comfortable pointing to them as a sole resource.

I went over-time on this video, but I still don't know that I was able to do this topic any sort of justice. First, I have to say that I said ""I"" a lot in the first paragraph because I was focusing on my own life but, of course, I had a lot of help doing those things I did (most of all from John.)

Second...we've had ups and downs in the strength of this community, and it's also a certain amount of scary for me when it seems like the focus of it is not as much values and goals, but me or John as people. There's a weird line between being the doorway into something bigger and more interesting and getting...stuck in the doorway. 

I want you to like me, but I don't want you to be here for me. I want you to be here for whatever message I'm sharing that day, whether it's one of joy and silliness, or of compassion, or of knowledge. 

But I also think I can sometimes be distracted from the importance of what we're doing here on Vlogbrothers by all of the new things that this community has allowed us to do. And since Vlogbrothers is still just me and John, while our other things have whole teams, it's easy to get dragged into those things by the great ideas those teams are having. 

Which is a bummer, because I don't want to be distracted from our work trying to figure out how cohesive and constructive community can find new ways to exist as the old ways are working for fewer and fewer people. 

Thank you for an amazing 10 years...good god, how lucky am I...

Epic Slow Memes - The Slow Mo Guys","On September 11th, 2001, America's freedom was attacked on its own soil.  Four airplanes were hijacked, two planes destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City, one plane struck the Pentagon, and the last plane's attempt at mayhem was hampered by heroic measures of the plane's passengers and made a crash landing in near Shanksville, PA.

America was attacked.  Its citizens were shocked and the country had questions that needed answers.  

George W. Bush made a joint address to Congress and to present the State of the Union on September 20th, 2001, to both memorialize the lives lost during the tragic events that unfolded 9 days prior, but also to outline his plans of foreign policy.  Many tout this speech to be Bush's finest moment in a one of the toughest times in recent American history.","Subscribe for more amazing videos! ► http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest​ ◄

It took more than seven years of design and construction to finish Hong Kong’s epic Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link (TMCLKL). The project set out to make a massive three-lane underwater highway that could cut travel time to the Hong Kong International Airport by 20 minutes and also reduce traffic on Hong Kong’s other busy highways. Construction had a massive budget of HK $46 billion-- about US $6.1 billion-- but it also broke tons of records, including use of the biggest tunnel boring machine in the world, the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok TBM. This incredible machine is as tall as a 6-story building and reduced the environmental impact as well as the amount of workers-- plus it sped up construction. 

There was plenty of other innovation poured into the project, like using the first caterpillar cofferdam in Hong Kong-- a structure used to keep water away from underwater tunnels and provide work space. But there were some setbacks that delayed the project by two years and caused a rift between the Highways Department of Hong Kong and the developers. Thankfully, it finally opened in December 2020. This Northern Connection was Hong Kong’s most ambitious tunnel project yet, elevating it to the likes of other ambitious underwater roadways like Japan’s Seikan Tunnel. Check out our video for everything you need to know about the record-breaking-- and budget-breaking-- Hong Kong construction project, as well as all the innovation that went into the successful connection of the Northern Territories with Lantau Island.

When Weiss fell ill with lung cancer, he relied heavily upon the calming effects of a holistic regime, integrating yoga, spiritual guidance and breathing techniques to ease his discomfort in addition to his Western medical treatments. During the course of his illness, Donna Karan realized that these complementary techniques were extremely helpful, yet sorely missing in traditional healthcare, and came up with the idea for the Urban Zen Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to reforming healthcare in partnerships with hospitals like Beth Israel.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

Take a look at the US Constitution and you’ll find that the president has fairly broad power to pardon individuals accused, charged or convicted of crimes against the federal government.

President Trump’s use of pardons early in his presidency, some believe, sends signals to his allies that Trump is willing to pardon them if they’re convicted of a crime in one of the several investigations surrounding the 2016 elections. The president has also repeatedly claimed that he could even pardon himself.

So what are the checks to a US president’s pardoning power and what does the Constitution have to say about this sort of self-serving pardoning?

I also realize now that this is my 400th video which is pretty cool as well and totally isn't gonna make me cry or anything.  Also just a clarification about when we are talking about not contributing to the online culture of flaunting your belongings, that's not shade at people.  I'm proud for people that do that and I think it's wonderful for them, I love to watch them and I think it's really cool when people are genuine about it because they deserve whatever they want to spend their money on, I just don't have that in me which was what I was trying to express.  Like I said I have some ""nice things"" guilt which is why I don't have a lot of nice things lol, not because I don't think they're nice I just feel weird having nice things, a nice house included.  IDK OKAY ITS COMPLICATED.  But this house is so important to us, it's our freedom and future and we just couldn't be happier so thank you for always supporting us in whatever stupid stuff we decide to do and make.  It's been a long journey for me personally to get here, I know a lot of you have been here for years and I just want to say thank you.  I'm getting very emotional now so I'm just gonna stuff those feelings down and pretend they aren't happening lol.  I'm looking forward to ruining my future kitchen table with acrylic nail supplies etc. because the salon will live on know what I'm sayin.  Anyways though, we are incredibly happy, and the next time you see us we will be in our new home.

With IGN’s Super Movie Madness underway, we’ve decided to take a deeper look into what separates a good superhero movie from a great one. In our first video, we’re going to look at how complex villains can provide deeper insights into the heroes trying to vanquish them.

Whether it be physical, psychological, or ideological, villains can provide contrast to a hero in many ways. Bane vs. Batman in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises, proved that Bane (Tom Hardy) was the ultimate physical foil to Batman (Christian Bale). Not only is he in better shape, but also had the same training as Batman. And in the Bane scenes where he traded blows with the Bat, it became clear that Batman was going to need to overcome a lot to defeat his facemasked foe. And in the process, Bruce Wayne realized Batman needed more than just brute strength to defeat his foes.

The next film we look at comes from Pixar. It’s The Incredibles directed by Brad Bird. In this film, we look at how Syndrome, the film’s villain, forces Mr. Incredible to confront the fact that his glory days are behind him.

Finally, we’ll dig into one of the most memorable villains of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Erik Killmonger. After the death of his father, T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman) ascends to the throne of Wakanda and becomes Black Panther. Wakanda is at a crossroads does it continue to remain an insular country or does it do more to help people of African descent around the world. Meanwhile, Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) believes the latter and has eyes on the Wakandan thrown to make his beliefs a reality. T’Challa ultimately defeats Killmonger in battle but his views are forever changed because of his conflict with Erik.

For more of our Super Movie Madness deep dives be sure to stay tuned to IGN.

#IGN​ #Gaming​ #Rust​","Explore the history and technology of Viking longships, which helped the Scandinavians conquer trade routes and new territories.

--

As the Roman Empire flourished, Scandinavians had small settlements and no central government. Yet by the 11th century, they had spread far from Scandinavia, gaining control of trade routes throughout Europe, conquering kingdoms as far as Africa, and building outposts in North America. What was the secret to their success? Jan Bill dives into the history of the formidable Viking longship.

Lesson by Jan Bill, directed by TOTEM Studio.

We worked with the Deaf community to develop Live Caption. With a single tap, Live Caption will automatically caption media on your phone.  As soon as speech is detected, captions will appear, all without opening another app, without ever needing wifi or cell phone data, and without anything leaving your phone.

Welcome back, Richest fans! For centuries, ships have helped carry some of the most valuable cargo to all parts of the world. Yet every so often, those ships could meet a terrible fate. Either through attack, poor weather, or another factor, those amazing boats may just sink to the bottom of the water. Their exact location could even be unknown to this day. But sometimes, the shipwrecks are found. Yet the cargo is still missing. Today, we’re going to look at some of the missing treasure that’s still waiting to be found. As well as see just how much money is potentially sitting on the seabed. 

Now for the spoiler paragraph. If you like surprises, we suggest you stop reading and watch the video multiple times. Firstly, we’ll look at the Treasure Fleet from 1715. Only a portion of its riches has been discovered so far. There’s the Sarcophagus of Menkaure that disappeared into the murky waters back in the 1830’s. We have the SS City of Cairo that still has some of its sunken treasure unaccounted for. We’ll examine Lake Guatavita and its connection to the tale of El Dorado. There’s the ship, the SS Gairsoppa, and a part of its precious cargo that hasn’t been found by treasure hunters yet. We have Lake Toplitz that has water with unusual properties. As well as a legend about sunken gold. We have the tale of the RMS Republic, who like The Titanic, was described as “unsinkable”. Finally, we have the Merchant Royal. A ship whose anchor was recently found. Yet the boat and its billion-dollar haul is still in hiding.

Eric Taylor hacked the director of the CIA, leaked classified information about the Obamas and the Kardashians, strong-armed experienced Russian hackers, stole from trillion-dollar companies, was hunted by the FBI, and got arrested… all before his sixteenth birthday.

But this kid wasn’t after money or fame - he wanted to make a political statement to the world: nowhere is safe online. 

These days, Taylor has made a remarkable turnaround, and now acts as a do-gooder, protecting others from the neverending cyber threats.

Satan, the beast crunching sinners’ bones. Lucifer, the fallen angel. Mephistopheles, the trickster striking deals. These three divergent devils are all based on Satan of the Old Testament. But unlike any of these literary devils, the Satan of the Bible was a relatively minor character. So how did he become the ultimate antagonist, with so many different forms? Brian A. Pavlac investigates.

If you read this far down the description I love you","A balanced carbon cycle produces as much CO2 as O2, and yet, there are 209,460 ppm of oxygen in the atmosphere and only 440 ppm of CO2 (up from the recent baseline of 275).

My first thought was that the CO2 is temporarily stored in vegetation, but the vegetative carbon sink doesn't store anywhere near enough CO2 to affect the O2 levels in the atmosphere. If we burned ALL THE VEGEATATION ON EARTH the oxygen concentration of the planet would drop by less than 1%. 

The CO2 storage of live vegetation is massively important for global warming, but it has no effect on our ability to breathe. 

SO WHY CAN WE BREATHE!? I got curious, so I made this video.

Thanks to this article for starting me on the path to making this video: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/...​

Nobody release In US Theaters on March 26 2021.
Nobody will be released in UK cinemas on 11th June 2021.

Sometimes the man you don't notice is the most dangerous of all. Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, Breaking Bad) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life's indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody.  

When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away.

The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch's long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire, and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon's McMafia)-and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.

Nobody is directed by acclaimed filmmaker Ilya Naishuller (Hardcore Henry), from a script by Derek Kolstad, the narrative architect of the John Wick franchise, and co-stars legendary Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd as Hutch's father and multi-hyphenate musician-actor RZA as Hutch's brother, whose own hidden talents aid Hutch in his quest for vengeance. 
 
The film is produced by Kelly McCormick and David Leitch, the filmmakers of Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw, Deadpool 2 and Atomic Blonde, for their company 87North, by Braden Aftergood (Hell or High Water, Wind River) for his Eighty Two Films, and by Bob Odenkirk and Marc Provissiero (Hulu's PEN15) for Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment. The film is executive produced by Derek Kolstad, Marc S. Fischer, and Tobey Maguire.","Sign up for DROPOUT.TV: http://bit.ly/2FhJBTg​

While IceBot is currently looked at for Antarctic exploration, researchers hope it could one day be used in space exploration missions. 

The idea is to have a robot that can build and repair itself using the abundantly available resources. On a cold planet, the robot could potentially source ice locally and use heat, water, or a power drill to sculpt and repair itself.

Hobos, or tramps, were itinerant workers and wanderers who illegally hopped freight cars on the newly expanding railroad in the United States in the late 19th century. They used graffiti, also known as tramp writing, as a messaging system to tell their fellow travelers where they were and where they were going. Hobos would carve or draw their road persona, or moniker, on stationary objects near railroad tracks, like water towers and bridges.

But news stories at the time spread tales of a different kind of graffiti. They included coded symbols that were supposedly drawn on fence posts and houses to convey simple messages to tramps. Seeing an image of a cat on a fence post indicated “kind lady lives here,” for example. While this language probably existed to a certain extent, it certainly was not as widespread as the media led readers to believe. In reality, these stories were largely informed by hobos — a group that took pride in embellishing stories so they could remain elusive.","MY MOST INSANE ACE EVER → https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3fQd...​

It was interesting going through this because I couldn't help but think about how what you put out does not necessarily equal what gets brought in. John is always such a kind and thoughtful and careful person, but so many of the GIFs in this list were him being angry or upset or frustrated...of course GIFs are in many ways units of emotion, and so of course emotion is going to be conveyed in them, but I think it says something that the most common emotions were forms of anger. 

Also, someone please explain the book sniffing to me!!

Join the Open Sourced Reporting Network: http://www.vox.com/opensourcednetwork​

Human faces evolved to be highly distinctive; it’s helpful to be able to recognize individual members of one’s social group and quickly identify strangers, and that hasn’t changed for hundreds of thousands of years. Then in just the past five years, the meaning of the human face has quietly but seismically shifted. That’s because researchers at Facebook, Google, and other institutions have nearly perfected techniques for automated facial recognition.
 
The result of that research is that your face isn’t just a unique part of your body anymore, it’s biometric data that can be copied an infinite number of times and stored forever. In this video, we explain how facial recognition technology works, where it came from, and what’s at stake.

Open Sourced is a year-long reporting project from Recode by Vox that goes deep into the closed ecosystems of data, privacy, algorithms, and artificial intelligence. Learn more at http://www.vox.com/opensourced​

#Deji​ #WeBrokeUp​ #Tank​","Dolly Rebecca Parton started her musical career at the early age of 10 and after writing songs for others for almost half a decade, she decided to launch her country music career in 1967 with her debut album titled Hello, I'm Dolly. Her album registered mediocre popularity and Dolly spent the remainder of the 60s working on her craft and releasing several solos as well as duet albums. During the 1970s and 1980s, Dolly delivered one hit song after the other and constantly stayed at the top of the charts. Dolly's career registered a bit of a downward trajectory in the 1990s. However, she bounced back with the new millennium and has delivered several successful albums under her label called Dolly Records since then.  

In her six-decades-long career, Dolly Parton has delivered 25 songs that reached the number one spot on Billboard and 44 country albums that occupied a spot on the top 10 country album list. She also has 49 Grammy nominations and 10 Grammy awards to her credit. Parton has often confessed that at the beginning of her career, she drew great inspiration from female country music artists, such as Rose Maddox, Brenda Lee, Molly O'Day and Patsy Cline. Until the late 1950s, the country music scene was dominated by male artists. However, during the late 1960s, Dolly created a name for herself within the country music industry and also paved way for other female artists. As an artist, Parton is as celebrated for her writing ability as well as her vocal talent. Her writing is often inspired by Appalachian ballads that were a part of her childhood days. Thus, Dolly often writes about stories, converting tragedies into songs.  

Other than her elaborate music career, Dolly Parton is also known for always speaking her mind. The fact that she has been open about her poverty-stricken past and is strongly committed to lending her voice to working-class opinions has made Dolly a favorite of men and women around the world. However, with fame comes gossip and rumors and Dolly has encountered many of those in her long career. In this video, we provide some clarity on the rumor that has long followed the country star: Dolly Parton is hiding ink on her body. So hit the play button and enjoy.

Bill considered his everyman looks his biggest asset and used it to bag offbeat characters that allowed him to prove his acting mettle. As his popularity grew as a character actor, he began getting more opportunities to play the lead roles. During the 80s, Paxton starred in several hit films, including The Terminator, Aliens and Weird Science. In 1992, the actor got his big break with One False Move. Thereafter, he starred in some of the most successful films of the decade including Apollo 13, Titanic and Twister. Between 2006 and 2011, Paxton starred in several TV shows. In 2017, he chose the Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre to undergo open-heart surgery. Ten days after surgery, the actor passed of complications related to the surgery. He was only 61 at the time.

AS ALWAYS KEEP IT REAL (⌐■_■)","Why Kashmir remains one of the most militarized regions in the world.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab​

The dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir is one of the longest running conflicts. Ever since Britain left India in 1947 and hastily drew borders demarcating a Hindu-majority India and a Muslim-majority Pakistan, Kashmir, located right between the two, has been fervently claimed by both nations.  

India and Pakistan’s first war was fought over Kashmir’s status as the the newly independent countries were being formed. After over a year of bloody conflict the UN stepped in and brokered a ceasefire that drew a line down the middle of Kashmir and gave a portion of the territory to India and the remainder to Pakistan. This arrangement was meant to be temporary. Once the violence settled a vote was to be held that would allow Kashmiris to decide their own future. 

But more than 70 years later, Kashmiris have yet to vote on their status. They remain stuck between two nuclear nations locked in a dangerous conflict with no end in sight.

When she was born, Laurence Olivier proudly declared that a great actress had just come on to the scene. British actress, Vanessa Redgrave, is best known for her roles in films like Blow-Up, Murder on the Orient Express, Julia, and Howard's End.

Nobody can accuse her of being an underachiever. In fact, she's quite the opposite. She is one of the most acclaimed and celebrated actresses of her generation. She's been nominated for six Oscars - of which she won one, 13 Golden Globes - winning two, and six Emmys -winning two more. 

Almost everyone in the Redgrave family is also an actor but clearly, Vanessa is the one that is the most applauded of her brood. Both of her late siblings, Lynn and Corin, were both actors as well. So was her daughter Natasha Richardson before she died in 2009 following a ski accident. Vanessa's other daughter Joely Richardson has also dabbled in acting over the years. 

And in case you were wondering, yes, she enjoys special British royal honors. Both Vanessa and her father, Michael Redgrave, both received the honorific title of CBE or Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.

AS ALWAYS KEEP IT REAL (⌐■_■)","Republican lawsuits in the 2020 Election don’t amount to much. But the future of election law under a new US Supreme Court is a different story. 
 
Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab​
 
When Joe Biden won the US Presidential election, President Donald Trump threatened legal action in some of the battleground states that were among the last to count their ballots. It was all part of a campaign to cast doubt on the legality of mail-in ballots, which disproportionately favored Joe Biden. The lawsuits themselves likely won’t alter the course of the election. But one in Pennsylvania sheds light on how the current US Supreme Court might rule on future election laws.

The famed Whydah Gally shipwreck eluded discovery for over 260 years, sending treasure-hunters, historians, and underwater archeologists of a seemingly never-ending chase to nothing and nowhere. But then, thanks to one man - a lucky explorer by the name of Barry Clifford, we have our answers.

The date was April 26th, 1717. A ship dubbed the Whydah had been infiltrated by pirates and was carrying gold, jewelry and valuables worth in excess of hundreds of millions of dollars. Over the choppy waters amidst a rough storm, it sank, taking the gold and the crew down with it. Centuries later, the treasure has finally been unearthed...

This video was produced in collaboration between Vox and BBCThree.

Over the course of her 63-year reign, Queen Victoria strategically planned marriages to place her descendants in royal families all over Europe. In doing so, she created one of the most remarkable royal families in history. 

By the early 19th century, Europe had been at war for decades. After the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars killed millions, European leaders came together to restore peace by reshaping major states for a new balance of power. Great Britain went on to become one of the strongest states. And years later, Queen Victoria and her husband Albert came up with a plan to maintain that political power — they married their children to monarchs across Europe. By the 1880s Queen Victoria’s children were in several important branches of Europe’s monarchies. 

The royal unions didn't play out as Queen Victoria planned, but she continued to make more matches anyway. She had 42 grandchildren, and these 7 ended up on royal thrones. Her grandchildren would end up on the thrones of Britain, Russia, Germany, Romania, Norway, and Spain leading up to the most destructive war Europe had ever seen.  

To truly understand the international conflicts and trends shaping our world you need a big-picture view. Video journalist Sam Ellis uses maps to tell these stories and chart their effects on foreign policy.

Welcome back, Richest fans! Hidden away in rural California, US, is the legendary Skywalker Ranch. Whilst its owner, George Lucas, doesn’t call this place home, it’s name has certainly grabbed the attention of Star Wars fans. Many fans will go on a pilgrimage to the ranch to see a piece of sci-fi history. The ranch itself is worth millions! Today, we’re going to take an in-depth look at this amazing place and what it’s exactly used for. We’ll then examine Lucas’ financial history in more detail. Including the Walt Disney deal that made him an absolute fortune. We’ll then look at a number of expensive Star Wars houses across the globe.

Now for the spoiler paragraph. If you like surprises, we suggest you stop reading and watch the video multiple times. Firstly, we have the examination of the Skywalker Ranch. We’ll see what is exactly on the property. Such as the Oscar-winning sound studio, Skywalker Sound. Then we have the finances of Lucas. Including is nearly $200 million donation to a film school! We have the Disney deal in detail that made him even richer! Next is the Star Wars houses. Firstly, there’s one that has the perfect private cinema for you to watch The Mandalorian on Disney Plus on repeat. There’s a house for rent that takes inspiration from a number of Star Wars locations. Including the Millennium Falcon. The last house seems to have its whole design based on Han Solo’s famous ship. Finally, we’ll look at the most expensive film prop sold at auction involving R2-D2!

Survivor has been on the air for more than 20 years, having put 40 seasons under its belt. Close to 600 castaways have competed in those 40 games, each one hoping to be crowned the final Survivor. While it’s a hard thing to accept for fans of the show, some of those contestants have unfortunately passed away in the intervening years since they competed in the game.

Some of them, like B.B. Andersen and Rudy Boesch, went on to reach old age before passing away. Others came to more tragic ends, in some cases not long after they competed on Survivor. It took ten years for the first cast death to hit the Survivor family, when Jenn Lyon passed away in 2010. But since then, seven other castaways have died from various causes. 

The families of some contestants, like Dan Kay and Ashley Massaro, kept their causes of death private. While it’s hard to avoid rumors when someone well-known passes away, there isn’t always a definitive answer to why it happened. Other contestants, like Caleb Bankston and Jenn Lyon, met tragic ends because of things outside of their control. 

In this video, we’re going to pay tribute to the Survivor castaways who have passed away since playing the game. You’ll also hear some of the heartfelt words shared by Survivor host, Jeff Probst, after these much-loved contestants died. It’s clear from his words how much of a family the Survivor cast really is. As fan, we’re lucky to be able to consider ourselves part of that extended family. 

If you’ve been a fan of the show since the beginning, some of these names will definitely stir up some good memories of many different seasons. Those memories will continue to live on with the fans long after these castaways passed on.

In our latest collaboration with ProPublica, we take a look at US election security and the status of American voting machines. Check out the full ProPublica report at: https://bit.ly/2Hw3Dcb​.

Stay tuned for more stories in this collaboration! If you’d like to sign up to receive more ProPublica journalism, go here: https://bit.ly/2IYkXqO​

In 2017, hackers Rick Rolled a voting machine in Las Vegas. Even though the machine was out-of-date and the demonstration didn’t replicate real-life conditions, the stunt brought national attention to an election crisis that has been building ever since the “hanging chad” fiasco that occurred during the 2000 Presidential election recount.

In her story on American election security, ProPublica’s Kate Rabinowitz revealed that many state and local election officials are suffering a funding crisis. Without the money needed to maintain and update electronic voting machines, officials are having to make do with equipment that was manufactured in 2008 or even earlier. At that time, most machines had recently been replaced thanks to the 2002 Help America Vote Act, but few have been updated since. 

By isolating machines from the internet and keeping them in secure locations, officials are able to reduce the threat of widespread hacking, but the machines are plagued with more mundane technical problems that states have been slow to address and could have major consequences for future elections.

On the bright side, the omnibus spending bill that was passed in March 2018 allocated $380 million dollars for state election officials to update their voting infrastructure. Whether that money is actually provided and how it will be spent, however, remains to be seen.

Drake has an extremely valuable car collection. His motorcade is worth $12 million, and he can often be seen driving one of his many supercars down the streets of Toronto. If you spot Drake in his Bugatti or Lamborghini, you will likely see numerous Cadillac Escalades riding right alongside him. Drake travels with a massive security detail at all times, and each one of Drake’s security guards is paid a handsome salary. Drake has used many of his cars in music videos. Drake’s most famous car might be his Bentley Continental GTC W12. The $220,000 luxury automobile appeared in Drake's music video for “Started from the Bottom.” Drake’s yellow Ferrari LaFerrari is one of his favorite supercars. He had a custom balloon replica made of the car and used it as a decoration during his 2018 tour. The remote-controlled yellow Ferrari balloon floated above his head while he rapped. Drake’s custom Lamborghini Aventador Roadster made him feel like Batman. “I feel like I’m Christian Bale,” he quipped after driving the supercar. Drake has numerous cars in his collection that cost more than $1 million. His Bugatti Veyron Sang Noir is worth about $2.2 million, and it is one of the rarest and most exclusive supercars ever made. Drake also owns a private jet called Air Drake that’s worth about $220 million. Drake received the jet as a gift from Cargojet. Drake wouldn’t be able to afford the jet himself as the cost of the private plane is higher than his net worth.

Masdar City is the eco-city of the future, but is it really as successful as its master plan says it will be? With a $22 billion budget, the Mubadala Development Company really hopes so. With a goal of reducing carbon emissions, using renewable energy sources, and creating brand new clean-tech innovations that’ll change the world, the futuristic city definitely had a lot to accomplish. It aims to have at east 50,000 residents living there upon completion in 2030, but so far only 4,000 workers and 1,300 students call this desert city their home. 

Masdar is developing a lot of cool technology, though. For one, they have awesome public transportation called the Personal Rapid Transit system that is made up of futuristic, electric and driverless pods that get people around the city underground. The city is also home to the world’s first university for artificial intelligence, the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, and the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology. There’s also a Tech Park where young innovators can collaborate, take courses and build prototypes together, as well as a mall called My City Center Masdar where residents can go for some retail therapy. As for accommodations, potential residents will love the city’s Eco-Villas, which cost about $200,000 and have their own solar panels. So, what would it be like to live in the world’s first eco-city, and is the project even going to be completed? Let’s have a look at Masdar City so far.

In baseball and cricket the best pitchers and bowlers know how to make the ball move due to the effects of aerodynamics. If one side of the ball is rough, the ball swings towards that side because turbulent air 'clings' to that side of the ball and is deflected. Although baseballs and cricketballs appear symmetric, they can be made to fly through the air with a smooth or rough side by judicious angling of the seams combined with the axis of rotation.","The Alienware Area-51m might be the ultimate portable desktop: a 17-inch laptop that adds interchangeable graphics cards and swappable desktop processors for the first time in years. This one fits up to an Nvidia RTX 2080 and an Intel Core i9-9900K, the fastest parts in a notebook yet. Alienware designed the Area-51m to be easily rebuilt so we tore it down to see what’s inside.

 I understand some things might have been left out (not on purpose) I'm not a doctor or a Vape expert or anything like that. But I did as much research as I could about the subject and this is what I found, my goal isn't to make everyone want to vape... I don't want a single person to start vaping after watching this video. I just wanted to explain to the people that think its SOOOO bad for you that it's really not as bad as people make it sound so me vaping occasionally in videos isn't like a crazy drug or anything.

Tesla has made a name for itself by upending things. They upended the idea of a sports car with their Lotus Elise derived all electric Roadster. Building on that success, they upended the luxury sedan world with a long range battery electric Model S. As if that wasn’t enough, the Model S proved to be a competent performance sedan, producing hypercar level 0-60 times. Meanwhile, they’ve launched their Powerwall business and bought SolarCity in the hopes of helping move the world towards renewable energy and away from dirtier fossil fuels. Other companies have reached for the goal of a car that runs on electricity, but even ones that run only partially on electricity have run into problems. Fisker was only able to produce its Karma hybrid sports car for a year before a faulty battery supply chain shutdown production. Tesla has no intention of getting caught up in that problem and has teamed up with battery partner Panasonic to invest $5 billion in a massive Gigafactory in Nevada that will produce enough batteries for 500,000 vehicles a year. As one could imagine, a Tesla factory is no ordinary factory. Tesla has managed to rethink every part of factory building, from modular prefabricated design the way the building heats and cools itself. Whether you call it the Gigafactory, Giga 1, or Giga Nevada, the Silver State’s massive battery factory is just the first of many that Tesla plans to build on every continent where EVs or batteries are sold and in the process take the world one step closer to a renewable energy future.

Thanks to Google Making and Science for helping me pursue my #sciencegoals​. If you want to try this experiment, instructions are here: link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12650-016-0383-5

The standard theory of quantum mechanics leaves a bit to be desired. As Richard Feynman put it, ""I think I can safely say that no one understands quantum mechanics."" This is because observations of experiments have led us to a theory that contradicts common sense. The wave function contains all the information that is knowable about a particle, yet it can only be used to calculate probabilities of where a particle will likely turn up. It can't give us an actual account of where the particle went or where it will be at some later time.

Some have suggested that this theory is incomplete. Maybe something is going on beneath the radar of standard quantum theory and somehow producing the appearance of randomness and uncertainty without actually being random or uncertain. Theories of this sort are called hidden variable theories because they propose entities that aren't observable. One such theory is pilot wave theory, first proposed by de Broglie, but later developed by Bohm. The idea here is that a particle oscillates, creating a wave. It then interacts with the wave and this complex interaction determines its motion.

Experiments using silicone oil droplets on a vibrating bath provide a remarkable physical realization of pilot wave theories. They give us a physical picture of what the quantum world might look like if this is what's going on - and this theory is still deterministic. The particle is never in two places at once and there is no randomness.

What do Euclid, 12-year-old Einstein, and American President James Garfield have in common? They all came up with elegant proofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem, one of the most fundamental rules of geometry and the basis for practical applications like constructing stable buildings and triangulating GPS coordinates. Betty Fei details these three famous proofs.

--

Which of the following is risky behavior: a person taking cholesterol medicine with grapefruit juice? Or a person taking Acetaminophen before going out for drinks? Or a person on blood thinners who takes an aspirin? Turns out, all of them are risky. Each has inadvertently created a drug interaction that could lead to serious complications.

Dubai Creek Tower will be the tallest structure in the world when it is completed. The 1345 meter observation tower will be the focal point of Dubai Creek Harbor district. The massive construction project has a price tag of at least $1 billion. Dubai and Suadi Arabia are in a skyscraper race. Jeddah Tower will surpass Burj Khalifa as the world’s tallest building, but Dubai Creek Tower will be significantly taller than both and lay claim to the title of world’s tallest structure. Dubai Creek Tower will feature luxury shops, restaurants, vertical gardens and even a hotel. Dubai Creek Harbor will feature luxury apartments and is expected to house up to 200,000 residents. Dubai Creek Tower is taller than the tallest waterfall in the world but it is not nearly as tall as Mount Everest or the Mariana Trench. Check out this video to learn about all the unique features on Dubai Creek Tower and how it compares to other tall buildings around the world. Dubai Creek Tower could be surpassed in height in just a few years. Engineers are working on new ways to build even bigger skyscrapers with wider bases. It’s possible skyscrapers could one day reach higher than Mount everest. Countries in the  Middle East are in competition for the tallest buildings in the world, but China has big plans for skyscrapers, too. Keep watching to see which building might top Dubai Creek Tower in the future.

Between Rep. Devin Nunes’ (R-CA) secret memo, allegations of missing text messages, and the panic over a so-called “secret society” in the FBI, the past few weeks of political news coverage have been dominated by Republican pseudoscandals. And while each of these alleged “bombshells” has turned out to be a dud, these stories raise questions about whether GOP politicians are intentionally baiting journalists -- trolling them into covering conspiracy theories in order to raise doubts about the FBI and the ongoing Mueller investigation.

https://bit.ly/3rCFiam​
Natalie Woods died almost 40 years ago but her death still remains a mystery. The public has been obsessed with her death for years, but that shouldn't overshadow her successful life. No doubt she would want to be remembered for her accomplishments.

Woods had a prolific career in Hollywood. She starred in dozens of films and was showered with accolades and awards. 

She was ahead of her times when it came to social issues as well. She was a champion for mental health, women's rights, and equality. She constantly made her voice heard when it came to these issues. 

She died on the evening of November 28, 1981. Robert Wagner, Christopher Walken, and Captain Dennis Davern took a yacht out to sea, but Woods wouldn't return on that vessel. She was found dead. Her death was deemed an accidental drowning but many details, witnesses, and conflicting pieces of information have called into question that conclusion for decades. 

This video is going to take a look at her life and death and hopefully shine a little bit of light on what happened on that fateful evening. One thing can be said with certainty. Natalie died much too young.","CLICK TO START: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVb7Xz...​

Each time you take a step, 200 muscles work in unison to lift your foot, propel it forward, and set it down. It’s just one of the many thousands of tasks performed by the muscular system: this network of over 650 muscles covers the body and is the reason we can blink, smile, run, jump, and stand upright. So how does it work? Emma Bryce takes you into the body to find out.

Jean Stapleton played Edith Bunker on TVs All in the Family.  Her character certainly was a memorable one, and in many ways she was the heart and soul of the sitcom while her bigoted husband Archie Bunker was the antagonist. She may have been naive, shrill, and gullible, but at the end of the day, she was also the voice of reason.

Stapleton appeared in all 205 episodes of All in the Family and then she reprised her role for the spin-off series Archie Bunker's Place. After episode 5 however, she asked for her character to be killed off the show. Norman Lear, the series creator, reluctantly agreed to her requests. He was heartbroken. To him, Edith was more than just a fictional character. 

This video is going to attempt to explain why Jean Stapleton wanted out and how the death of Edith Bunker subsequently affected the show. Did it tank as soon she made her exit or was it able to find its footing again? And what exactly did Edith bring to the mix in the first place? We'll discuss all of these questions and more as we take a quick behind-the-scenes look at Edith Bunker and All in the Family.  

Why Edith Was Killed off All in the Family","THAT WAS AWESOME

Originally when writing this video there was quite a lot more about nails and stress and also about how the mindless acquisition of something that previously held value beyond any objective utility creates more stress than it alleviates, but then it got to be a LOT about money and not a lot about community so I'm saving that for later. But if you noticed the ghost of that argument hiding in this video...well done. 

Also, I made this video yesterday, so I didn't have time to consider the geopolitics of January 3, 2020. However, I am also not an expert on Iran, so I basically have nothing useful to say except, ""It's ok to not know what's going on right now. It's going to take a while before anyone knows.""

In a region where food is already scarce, billions of insects are now eating everything in sight.

Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-lab​

Since late 2019, East Africa and the Middle East have been experiencing their worst locust outbreaks in decades. A small locust swarm can eat more food than 35,000 people; but some locust swarms in the area have grown to over two thousand times that size. And it’s all coming right on the heels of a season of catastrophic flooding in the region.

But that isn’t a coincidence: The desert locust thrives when dry weather turns wet. And in 2018 and 2019, a series of freak weather events brought record-setting rainfall to the Middle East and East Africa. The result of all this is a region at risk of a famine, in the middle of a pandemic. And because freak weather is a hallmark of climate change, it’s also the kind of thing we can expect to happen again.

Further reading / watching:

Read Vox.com science reporter Umair Irfan’s article on the locust outbreak:
https://www.vox.com/2020/5/20/2115828...​

One of the things that helped prime the region for locusts was an unusually strong Indian Ocean Dipole. Watch our piece about that here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYX9a...​

For more information on the locust upsurge, see the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization’s website:
http://www.fao.org/ag/locusts/en/info...​

And this FAO press conference from February helped me answer a lot of the questions in this piece:

One thing that I did not say in this video...that's just for you dear dedicated  dooblydoo reader...is that ""stressing out"" as we sometimes call it (focusing on the worry rather than the work) is a kind of flight. It is the easiest, most monkey-brain thing to do. There is nowhere to run, and we don't want the unpleasantness of engaging with the fight, so we flee into fear and it eats us because we literally have no defense against it. 

If you'd like to learn more about stress and our physiological responses to it, here's a SciShow on how presistent stress harms our bodies: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViWCk...​

Stars have been using their fame and elevated social status to seduce people since long before the word 'celebrity' was even a part of our vernacular. Celebrity culture, as we're familiar with it today, really started to emerge in the 20th century when technological advancements such as the radio, television and cinema made it viable for stars to reach audiences far throughout the world. A wider audience meant a bigger pool of potential partners.

Michael Cohen, former personal lawyer and fixer for Donald Trump, has admitted that he violated campaign finance laws when he paid $130,000 to adult film actress Stormy Daniel in the weeks before the 2016 elections. 

Now that Cohen pleaded guilty on eight federal charges, including two campaign finance violations, the biggest unanswered question is whether the president will also be held accountable.

Much science fiction features white male heroes who blast aliens or become saviors of brown people. Octavia E. Butler knew she could tell a better story. She built stunning worlds rife with diverse characters, and brought nuance and depth to the representation of their experiences.

Every time you send something on the internet, it’s a copy. But using new technology, can we make digital goods that are... rare? 

That’s the question behind CryptoKitties, a new game to buy, breed, and sell digital cats on the blockchain. These cats are more similar to real-world collectibles like beanie babies or baseball cards than they are to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. 

In just the last few months, a whole community of third party sites and services has formed around CryptoKitties. And fans have spent more than $23 million playing along. 

All of this is made possible by the clever and surprising code behind the game.

Diana Hyland was an actress who made a name for herself in television during a fairly short career from the 60s and 70s. Although she never had a huge breakthrough role, she is likely familiar to most television watchers from that period in one way or another. Towards the end of her life, she would get one of her biggest breaks in the form of the 1977 sitcom Eight Is Enough. However, fate had other plans for the late star.

From roles in made-for-television movies to guest-starring slots on various series, Hyland was all over television during her short career. She starred in minor roles on nearly 80 different television productions over the span of less than two decades. One of her most notable roles was in the made-for-television movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble. In that film, she played the mother of the titular character, who himself was portrayed by the burgeoning young star John Travolta.  

On top of being a breakthrough role for the both of them, The Boy in the Plastic Bubble was also the start of a romance between Hyland and Travolta. Although they had a pretty big age difference between them, their romance would last until Hyland's death. Soon after filming her role, Hyland would move on to Eight Is Enough. However, she would only be able to film four episodes of that series before life revealed that it had other plans. Join Facts Verse as we attempt to uncover the reason Diana Hyland only shot 4 episodes of Eight Is Enough.

We’re taught to look both ways before crossing the street, cover our moths when we cough or sneeze, and wear a helmet, just to name a few essentials. But for as much emphasis that’s placed on “real world” safety, many people still overlook basic safety practices online.

92% of Americans say they care about online safety, but their actions show otherwise. Like the real parents in the video above, the majority of people use one or a handful of different passwords for all their accounts, and a third have shared their password with others.

Habits like these can make you an easy target for hackers, fraudsters, and data breaches. In 2019 alone, identity fraud losses totaled $16.9 billion. Moreover, it can take anywhere between 100 hours and six months to fix the effects of identity theft. For parents, this can be especially costly. Families with children under 18 are 128% more likely to be victims of identity fraud compared to the average American, and they pay more than twice as much out of pocket as a result of identity fraud.

In 1982, a young nurse was suffering from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize or concentrate. One controversial treatment changed everything: after two courses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) her symptoms lifted. So what exactly is electroconvulsive therapy and why is it so stigmatized? Helen M. Farrell details the history and evolution of ECT.

GOP Delays COVID-19 Relief; Harry and Meghan’s Big Interview | The Tonight Show

#FallonTonight​
#JimmyFallon​","On the evening of the election here in the US, I tweeted my most re-tweeted tweet ever: ""I know many many wonderful people who are dedicated to making the world a better place and that's a thing that will not change tonight.""

I know that lots of people are hopeful and pleased that we have a new president today. I am not. I am very worried. Many of the things I care about most, our new president is actively antagonistic toward. 

But that tweet is true no matter who controls the @POTUS Twitter account.

I am not just hopeful, I am excited about the future. And much of that has to do with these great people who I am lucky enough to work with. I know that I'm their boss, and they know that too, but I hope they also know that our goal isn't to create money, it's to create value. It's to make things that people love, and that they care about, and that maybe even help them become better people.

If you're feeling particularly drained by the political climate where you live, I suggest looking to the people  you know in the real world rather than the ones you imagine are taking over your country. My guess is that there's a lot of hope there.

With support from Google’s veteran community, a group of U.S. veterans ranging from a Google employee to a retired Admiral shared firsthand stories about the value of coming forward and asking for help. 

In this video, retired General Peter Chiarelli, former Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, advocates for reducing stigma around post-traumatic stress, highlighting that invisible wounds are as real as visible ones.

Ted Danson's long career as an actor, particularly in sitcoms, has earned himself the nickname ""The King of Sitcom."" After discovering a huge passion for acting while in college, Ted Danson soon devoted his life to the craft. He began with local theatre, and slowly worked his way up to larger productions. Finally, he made his transition to on screen acting.

Ted Danson's first time appearing on screen was on a day-time soap opera called Somerset. Despite these humble origins, however, Ted Danson's talent would eventually prevail, and before long, he would land the role of the lead character, Sam Malone, in the iconic NBC sitcom, Cheers. After Cheers eventually ended in 1993, Ted Danson had no trouble continuing his career in both film and television. While Ted Danson's role as Sam Malone will likely remain the most iconic and memorable character of his acting career, he has proved time and time again that he is capable of branching out into many other forms of acting. 

Today, Ted Danson is still amazing his fans with his acting skills, and more recently, he has played the role of Michael in the beloved sitcom The Good Place. Throughout his career, Ted Danson has been nominated for a stunning 18 Primetime Emmy Awards, 11 Golden Globe Awards, and one Screen Actors Guild Award. He has also been awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. However, Ted Danson's career is far from over. Even at 73, he shows no signs of retiring from his prolific career anytime soon! In fact, it's likely he will continue with his passion for the rest of his life. 

Despite being a huge name in Hollywood, however, Ted Danson is rather unusual. While many celebrities and actors are known for short and fickle relationships, Ted Danson has been lovingly married to Mary Steenburgen for over 25 years! Even more amazing is the fact that the two publicly gush over each other even after all this time. But what is the secret to this long and loving relationship? 

In today's video, we're going to take a look at the long and winding road that finally brought Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen together. Ted Danson may be with the love of his life at the moment, but there were a lot of ups and downs, both romantically and in his career, that finally brought the two of them together forever. Make sure you stick around, because we're also going to reveal how Ted Danson's crush on a girl in college actually caused him to become an actor! We hope you like this video, and don't forget to subscribe to Facts Verse for more!

The twin study showing correlated attractiveness is stronger for identical twins:

Some things we know make mosquitoes more attracted to you:
Exercising, higher metabolism, higher body temperature, more body odor, being pregnant, type O blood, infrequent bathing, lactic acid, ammonia, acetone.

There are a number of folk remedies people believe protect them from mosquito bites like drinking alcohol, eating garlic, or taking vitamin B. These do not appear to provide any benefit in lab studies and in fact drinking alcohol is associated with increased mosquito activity because it causes blood vessels near the surface of the skin to dilate.

And apparently some of your attractiveness to mosquitos is simply genetic. This may be mediated through your immune system, which is what a lot of the genes identified were associated with.

Everyone is probably familiar with Hooters and what they have to offer their diners, but you probably haven't heard about Bombshells Bar and Grill yet, have you? Bombshells offers casual American comfort food served up by curvaceous waitresses. Their food is inexpensive, their bar is fully-stocked and as of December, they've announced plans of expanding.

This Dallas based chain has challenged the supremacy of Hooters for the 'breastaurant' category of restaurants, but they aren't the only ones to offer up their own takes on the concept. The Tilted Kilt and Twin Peaks are both similarly themed establishments that have been experiencing sizable growth in recent years. 

Hooters sales figures have been shrinking in recent years. It seems that their business model only appeals to a small subset of the aging baby-boomer generation. If they want to stay alive and find success in the next generation, then they are going to have to give their entire company a major overhaul. 

Is it the uniform? Is it the menu? What about their business model needs to change if Hooters wants to appeal to modern consumers? This video is going to be looking at all of these areas and what Hooters needs to do if they don't want to shutter all of their doors. The times are changing. It's not 1983 anymore. 

Hooters Is Losing to This New Breastaurant","Stevie Wonder's irresistible ode to jazz, explained

Jacob Collier is a rising star in his own right and is Stevie Wonder's self-proclaimed greatest fan. Here, he breaks down the jazz influences and syncopations Stevie uses to create the magic that is ""Sir Duke.""

All year long, researchers at hospitals around the world collect samples from flu patients and send them to top virology experts with one goal: to design the vaccine for the next flu season. But why do we need a new one every year? Vaccines for diseases like mumps and rubella offer a lifetime of protection with two shots early in life; what’s so special about the flu? Melvin Sanicas explains.

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

When the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994, auto companies in the US, Canada and Mexico could trade parts and cars without paying tariffs. And they could source parts and labor from the cheapest places. That is a big reason why US car prices have only risen seven percent in 25 years. 

But the US Mexico Canada Agreement -- or USMCA for short -- could change that; the new law would increase the regulations that car manufacturers need to meet in order to sell tariff-free cars. 

We built a Ford Mustang to explain.

Lotus silk is one of the rarest and most coveted fabrics in the entire world. Its popularity comes from it being amazingly soft, wrinkle-resistant, stain-resistant, durable and eco-friendly. But its incredible price-- about ten times the cost of normal silk-- is mostly due to how scarce it is. It’s typically made in only three places around the world-- Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Harvesting and extracting the silk threads is also a long and delicate process. It comes from the stems of lotus flowers and can only be harvested during certain months of the year. It can take two months of harvesting and processing to make just one single scarf, and even a small scarf can cost more than $200. 

There aren’t many people trained in the delicate process of extracting the threads from the stems and there are a lot of conditions that must be met to keep the fabric from getting ruined. Vietnamese weaver Phan Thi Thuan is one of the innovators training people in how to work with the threads so that the market for lotus silk can grow and enrich her community. Thankfully lotus silk does have a lot of benefits for its price tag, including calming properties and a belief that it can improve heart, lung, and throat health. Here are all the details on how lotus silk is made, why one lotus silk jacket sold for $5,600, and the differences between normal silk and lotus silk that make it worth the investment.

If you feel like there’s been a ton of turnover at the Trump White House, there has been. In fact, Trump’s White House has seen more turnover in its first year than each of the past five administrations. And he’s beaten the record by a lot — at 34 percent he’s more than doubled the rate of turnover of the previous record holder, Ronald Reagan. 

High staff turnover at the White House isn’t necessarily unusual. Each of the past five presidents had turnover within their staff. But the sheer number of people leaving the Trump administration is unusual. Is this cause for concern?

https://www.youtube.com/user/TheLette...​
 
Also, thanks to everyone who submitted videos! It was fascinating to see what people were more likely to keep or discard vs. what I would have kept. 

More on how I chose this particular video below, but first:

SOME RUNNERS UP!

Most Trippy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...​

Squishiest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEP9p...​

Not Starring Hank: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXqoQ...​

Most Wonderful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQivR...​

Best Analog Graphics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUp-L...​

Best Pigeon Dialogue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvFhJ...​

Closest to Exactly What I Would Have Done: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_co...​

Casey Neistatiest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl5ng...​

---

So, in the voting, there were several videos that got more votes than this. But I picked this video for two reasons:

1. It was the one that still felt like something I might have made (even though it was better than what I would have done.) I felt like it captured the spirit of the video I intended to make.

2. Of anyone, I think this video had the highest votes to views ratio, at over 50%. So half of the people who saw the video voted for it, which is pretty dang impressive.

3. I really liked it a whole lot! There were, of course, lots of other moments in lots of other videos that were fantastic and hilarious, but I felt like this one had the highest concentration, as well as a really good story structure with multiple little arcs that all worked really well.

Facts Verse has done our homework and has gotten to the bottom of this matter. We're going to show you just how much of Gold Rush is really just fools gold. You know what they say about how not all that glitters is really gold, right? 

We'll put that saying to the test and figure out which elements of the show seem to be legit and what parts just don't quite add up with the facts. Fortunately, we live in a golden age (pun intended) of information gathering. We're scoured the web and interviews to hear from the source what's real and what's straight-up dirt.","►GET TEAM DEJI SHIRTS HERE: http://goo.gl/RRjUWJ​

China's Belt and Road Initiative is the most ambitious infrastructure project in modern history. It spans over 60 countries and will cost over a trillion dollars. The plan is to make it easier for the world to trade with China, by funding roads, railways, pipelines, and other infrastructure projects in Asia and Africa. China is loaning trillions of dollars to any country that's willing to participate and it's been a big hit with the less democratic countries in the region. This makes the BRI a risky plan as well. But China is pushing forward because its goals are not strictly economic, they're also geopolitical.

The Disney brand is fascinating, including the ways in which that brand reaches so far beyond any set of words or bands and into a deep cultural idea. It is, in some ways, outside of what we usually consider a brand, and in other ways maybe the most powerful brand outside of, like, nation states. 

Thanks to these people for their knowning or un-knowing help:

Here's a good tidbit I had to cut from this video...in 1922, which Ubbe Iwerks (co-creator of Mickey Mouse) first met Walt Disney, Walt was 19 years old and was literally practicing variations on his signature! Disney's constant variation of his signature apparently started at an early age, and the piece of his signature that he seemingly couldn't settle on was the D. In the end, it was likely not Disney who created this iconic D, but someone working at the company after his death. 

Walt Disney was obsessed with the ""Disney"" image...with his own image and that of his creations. That was certainly unhealthy. It also probably had some seriously negative consequences on him and the people around him. But it also played a part in creating something wonderful.

I REALLY HOPE I DIDN'T GET ANYTHING TOO WRONG IN THIS VIDEO!

So we ended last episode with the proliferation of command line (or text) interfaces, which sometimes used screens, but typically electronic typewriters or teletypes onto paper. But by the early 1960s a number of technologies were introduced to make screens much more useful from cathode ray tubes and graphics cards to ASCII art and light pens. This era would mark a turning point in computing - computers were no longer just number crunching machines, but potential assistants interactively augmenting human tasks. This was the dawn of graphical user interfaces which we’ll cover more in a few episodes.

Today we’re going to talk about good and bad surveys. From user feedback surveys, telephone polls, and those questionnaires at your doctors office, surveys are everywhere, but with their ease to create and distribute, they're also susceptible to bias and error. So today we’re going to talk about how to identify good and bad survey questions, and how groups (or samples) are selected to represent the entire population since it's often just not feasible to ask everyone.

--

The bad backs, elbow pain, and creaky knees so common in older people often aren't just “old age.” In fact, the source of this stiffness plagues many young people as well. The culprit is arthritis: a condition that affects over 90 million people in the U.S. alone. What makes arthritis so pervasive, and why haven’t we found a cure for it? Kaitlyn Sadtler and Heather J. Faust investigate.

In fact, she and her then-husband, Caitlyn Jenner, had a little ""hanky-panky,"" all while Khloé and her friend were still in the room – resulting in a traumatizing incident for everyone. The Kardashian matriarch also gave an update on Kim and her diligent studies to become a lawyer, shared her thoughts on Khloé and Tristan possibly having a second child, the end of ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" after 14 years, and talked about her brand new collaboration with Chrissy Teigen called Safely, offering plant-based home cleaning and self-care products!","CRAZY SPIDER PRANK ON MY GIRLFRIEND!!

Welcome back, Richest fans! Simon Cowell is one of the biggest, non-musicians in the music industry. He went from working at a record label to creating his own. Bringing talent such as One Direction, Leona Lewis, Westlife, and many more onto the world’s stage. Along the way, Cowell made many successful talent shows. Such as the X Factor, American Idol, the Got Talent series, and so on. Due to all these successes, Cowell is worth an absolute fortune! Today, we’re going to see how he spends his hundreds of millions on expensive purchases! As well as how he became the wealthy celebrity he is today.
Now for the spoiler paragraph. If you like surprises, we suggest you stop reading and watch the video multiple times. Firstly, we’ll look at Cowell’s net worth and how much his salary is said to be. Then, we’ll explore his expensive mansions. Such as the one in Beverly Hills. As well as his various London properties. Then there’s his incredible car collection. Which includes a stunning Bugatti Veyron and a Rolls-Royce. We’ll explore his business dealings. Such as creating Syco Entertainment and how Sony are involved. There are also the pricey items he’s purchased. Such as a luxury watch that’s worth thousands. We’ll also take a look at the luxury superyacht that he uses when enjoying some relaxation. As well as his private plane that’s worth millions! Finally, we’ll look at all his charity work and donations. Such as supporting causes involving dogs. As well as helping children get the help they desperately need.

When paleontologists uncover a dinosaur they usually only find part of the animal, but when we walk through a museum we see exhibits that paint a full picture – so how do they fill in all those blank spaces? In the early 1900’s artists used to hand carve the pieces, but we’ve come a long way in the past century  – both technologically and scientifically. 

Now, we’re living in what some call a “golden age” for paleontology. Researchers are uncovering nearly one new species of dinosaur a week – making building exhibits easier and more efficient.

Norell’s newest exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History called T.Rex: The ultimate predator is open through August 9th 2020: https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/t-re...​

If you want to learn more about the Brontosaurus mishap and revival you can read the study here: https://peerj.com/articles/857/​

Throughout the research, I also found this really awesome interactive graphic that show where and when various fossils were found: https://paleobiodb.org/navigator/​

In recent years, research shows that more and more women are saying that they feel beautiful. But at the same time, the vast majority of women say they feel pressure to be beautiful. Glad You Asked hosts Cleo Abram and Joss Fong explore the benefits and costs of today’s beauty culture.

Sacha Baron Cohen has a net worth of about $160 million, which makes him one of the richest comedians in Hollywood. Cohen’s hit film Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make benefit Glorious nation of Kazakhstan earned $262.6 million at the box office and turned Cohen into an instant star. However, Cohen reportedly only made $5 million for the film. The Borat sequel, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, was recently released on Amazon Prime Video. Amazon secured the streaming rights to the movie in a lucrative deal. Cohen earned as much as $30 million for both Bruno and the Dictator. Both movies were box office hits, but not as successful as Borat. Cohen has used his massive paydays to buy mansions and luxury cars. He owns an Audi A8 and numerous properties in California. He and his wife also own a stunning property in London. Cohen has donated both his time and money to charity. He has appeared in BBC’s comic relief and Seth Rogen’s Hilarity for Charity. Cohen donated $1 million to help Syrian refugees receive vaccinations and healthcare. Cohen has also donated to numerous charities like the Anti-defamation league, UNICEF, Charity Projects Entertainment Fund, Clothes Off Our Back, Declare Yourself, Project Hope, and Feeding America. Cohen’s movies have grossed over $3.5 billion at the box office, and he is one of the richest Britons in the world. Keep watching to see how Sacha Baron Cohen earns and spends all his money.","Sorry it's been so long since we posted a video, this took a bit longer than expected.

It was the dawn of 1863, and London's not-yet-opened subway system — the first of its kind in the world — had the city in an uproar. Most people thought the project, which cost more than 100 million dollars in today's money, would never work. So how did they do it? Christian Wolmar explains how the London Underground was built at a time when no one had built a railway under a city before.

Most of the time, when we think of the mafia, we think of the movie The Godfather, or Goodfellows, or maybe even Road to Perdition.  But all these examples of the mob are such a small slice of what organized crime groups look like around the world.  In fact, it’s safe to say that if you think you know the mafia because you’ve seen The Godfather, then you ain’t seen nothin yet.  Hope a plane halfway across the world to Japan, and you’ll find that organized crime goes by another name.  Here, they are not known as the mafia, or the mob.  They are referred to as the yakuza.  And they are some of the most powerful groups in the country.  The yakuza have been around for over a century, and they have their hands in many different areas of the Japanese economy.  From gambling, to business, to entertainment, and yes, even politics, the yakuza have been pulling the strings for years, and slowly shaping the country to their will.  So, what is the deal with these guys?  How did they get so powerful?  And reportedly, they bring in over $80 billion dollars every year, so, just how are they accomplishing this feat?  Well, stick around for today’s video, because we are discussing all these topics and more, as we get to the bottom of the Japanese mafia-- known as the yakuza.  We’re sure you’ll think a little differently about where the powers in Japan lie after you see what we’ve dug up for you.

Before they were famous, these celebrities were sleeping on park benches, living in their cars, and frequenting homeless shelters. You’d never know that today though, since these celebrities are worth as much as $600 million, but sometimes you’ve really got to start at the bottom before you make it big. Just ask Jim Carrey, who once lived in a tent, or Sylvester Stallone, who used to call a bus stop his home. 

Whether they’re actors or musicians, these stars knew they had something special-- they just had to find a way to show the world. That’s why Halle Berry and Jennifer Lopez ran away from home to pursue their passions, and even though they ended up homeless for a while, they could never regret the path that has resulted in them becoming multi-talented millionaires. Considering that Jennifer Lopez makes $40 million a year, wouldn’t you agree? From Chirs Pratt’s job stripping at birthday parties to the $5 million that Tyler Perry raised himself to get his first movie off the ground, these are some of the best rags-to-riches stories out there. From the streets to Hollywood, these stars might have made it big, but they’ll never forget where they came from. Check out our video for the richest celebrities that used to be homeless, and don’t forget to stick around until the end to find out what one famous singer had to do when she lost everything in a fire.

Matlock is a very expensive criminal defense attorney based in Atlanta. He charges $100,000 to take on a case but fortunately, he is worth every last cent. He and fellow lawyers defend his clients by always finding out who the real assailant is. 

His goal is always simply to prove beyond a reasonable doubt his client's innocence and he succeeds almost 100 percent of the time. 

Why Julie March Left Matlock for Good","Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" is a different kind of war movie. It's a multi-genre film that maybe says more about human psychology than it does about war. In this episode of Crash Course Film Criticism, Michael Aranda takes us on a trip through the Vietnam War through the eyes of a director at the end of his rope.

ALWAYS STAY SLOTHY \(._.)/","Dive into the history and controversy of Igor Stravinsky’s ballet, “The Rite of Spring,” which shattered the conventions of classical ballet. 

--

Ballet is typically thought of as harmonious, graceful and polished— hardly something that would trigger a riot. But at the first performance of Igor Stravinsky's “The Rite of Spring,” audience members were so outraged that they drowned out the orchestra. People hurled objects at the stage, started fights and were arrested. What caused this shocking reaction? Iseult Gillespie explains the controversy.

Grace Slick was the singer-songwriter of the highly influential psychedelic rock band Jefferson Airplane. She helped pen such classics like 'White Rabbit' and 'Somebody to Love'.

In 1970, she was invited to go to a gathering at the White House hosted by Tricia Nixon, Richard Nixon's daughter. The two had gone to the same college and Tricia wanted to have alumnae over for tea.

Slick seized this opportunity to devise a devious plot. Along with Abbie Hoffman, who she planned on taking with her as her guest, she planned on dosing the president with LSD. If only she could chat him up at the event, she might just be able to slip a little bit of the powerful mind-altering drug into his beverage.

Find out if her plan worked and what repercussions she and Hoffman faced for their shenanigans. We're also going to take a closer look at Grace Slick's life before and after this notorious incident and see where she ended up. Find out what her biggest struggle was and what she is doing today in this blast-from-the-past groovy video.","For this video, HD stands for ""High Disgusting"" as Gav and Dan try to fend off the female attention by flapping their faces in a disturbing manner.

While many of us, perhaps, are not expecting to hear the energetic call of Tattoo as a plane keeps soaring over the head in the new production of Fantasy Island, we are still quite excited about the edgier or, what some of you may say, darker take on the ABC series featuring Ricardo Montalban that was running from 1978 up to 1984. Some privileged guests have the opportunity to be hosted on a faraway island set in the Pacific Ocean to live their extraordinary fantasies, courtesy: a mysterious proprietor to learn that it is often dangerous to receive what you desire.

The trailer of the new Fantasy Island depicts a picturesque island retreat, much like its original series, and a fresh crop of guests to be tantalized. Their wishes range from frightening an old, high-school bully up to playing soldier with real-life rounds in a dense jungle. Fans will realize that each of the fantasies seems to be taking a drastic turn just for the worst. It turns out that this was not that far off from the original series. Here are 10 things all viewers must know about the new Fantasy Island expected to be released next summer. 

We also have insights for those who are wondering about a sequel to the movie released in 2020. 

Well, Sony in collaboration with Blumhouse has not, at least so far, announced any sequel to Fantasy Island. Although, we can say that even though there is some potential for yet another movie, it will not be a hi-fi franchise, and will most likely be a comparatively unknown entity when it comes to the larger scheme of things. Hence, an announcement of one more movie or a successful discovery of franchising in the near future may come not before the months after its summer release as it also depends on how the latter does.

Can't Stop Won't Stop - Mighty & High
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPi3Z...​","How does ballet convey narrative, emotion, and character? Dive into “The Sleeping Beauty” to see how a ballet creates its essential elements. 

--

A baby cursed at birth. A fierce battle of good and evil. A true love awoken with a kiss. Since premiering in 1890, “The Sleeping Beauty” has become one of the most frequently staged ballets in history. So what makes this piece so beloved? And what exactly does ballet bring to this— or any other— story? Ming Luke shares what makes ballet the perfect medium for stories old and new. 

Lesson by Ming Luke, directed by Visorama.

It’s a laptop that can be upgraded like a desktop, including both its CPU and GPU. The new Area-51m starts at around $1,950 and can be configured well north of $5,000. It is a behemoth that calls back to the time when all gaming laptops were thick, heavy computers that never left the comfort of a sturdy desk.

#FallonTonight​
#JimmyFallon​","The thing to remember here is that finding life on another planet tells us one of very two things...and we will be able to figure out which thing pretty quickly. Either:

1. The life will contain clear signals that it is related to life on Earth, which will tell us that life can and does travel between planets. This would be huge, and it we could even potentially track how long it has been since the two lineages diverged.

2. The life will contain clear signals that it is not related to life on Earth, which would tell us that life can arise relatively easily, and mean that the Universe is filled with living systems. It would also allow us to study a living system that is not our's which is one of the most exciting things I can imagine. 

But again, it's entirely possible that life is rare, and that it only arose once in our solar system. Only one way to find out! GOTTA KEEP LOOKING!!!

Subscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO​

Scientists have directly observed sea level rise since the late 18th century. And as they forecast the next 20, 50, and 100 years, sea level rise will continue to accelerate at an alarming rate. That rise won’t just threaten homeowners on the coast -- it will also impact the critical infrastructure that supports many of our largest cities.

While sea level rise is often phrased as an issue of concern in the future, we can already see some of the implications. Many coastal communities have witnessed a sharp uptick in flooding, during lunar king tide periods. Other places are forced to consider what life might be like as the land they currently occupy goes underwater.

Welcome to our first-ever week of programming for kids! 

Earlier this year I noticed a bird nest with a single bright blue egg sitting on my front porch. Over the course of a few days, the single egg turned into four, and in a few more days, they hatched. What I witnessed over the course of watching these birds grow was magical, but it also left me with a lot of questions about what goes on in the beginning of a bird's life. 

My biggest question: Where does all the bird poop go? 

To answer all of my question about these baby birds, I spoke with professor of biology and lifelong bird lover Michael Murphy about the weird and often gross things birds do to survive. 

If you're looking to learn more about birds here are two incredible resources:

You’re on an airplane when you feel a sudden jolt. Outside your window nothing seems to be happening, yet the plane continues to rattle you and your fellow passengers as it passes through turbulent air in the atmosphere. What exactly is turbulence, and why does it happen? Tomás Chor dives into one of the prevailing mysteries of physics: the complex phenomenon of turbulence.

These AIs are often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? Briana Brownell digs into the three basic ways machines investigate, negotiate, and communicate.

Your hands, up close, are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? Alex Rosenthal and Pall Thordarson investigate.

STAY AWESOME GUYS! :D","The TV series The Fugitive captivated America with its high-stakes, dramatic plot. The show was created by Roy Huggins, an author who created other narrative-driven television shows like The Rockford 

Files and Maverick. The Fugitive aired from September 1963 to August 1967 on ABC, and it aired a total of 120 episodes, each one clocking it at around 51 minutes long. Out of the four seasons, the first three were filmed in black and white. However, the fourth and final season was filmed in color. 

The Fugitive was quite different from many of the other TV shows at the time, because its narrative structure didn't allow episodes to resolve neatly each time. This kept audiences on their toes throughout the whole duration of the show. It was ranked by TV Guide as the best dramatic series of its decade, and it also earned a spot as number 36 TV Guide's list of greatest television shows of all time, as of 2002. The show was also nominated for five Emmy awards, and in 1966, it won the Emmy for Outstanding Dramatic Series. 

The show was most popular in its second season, when it was ranked as the fifth most popular TV show according to the Nielsen ratings. While it wasn't quite as popular during its third and fourth seasons, a staggering amount of audience members tuned into the series finale, proving that it never truly lost favor within the country. 

The show has remained incredibly popular, so much so that it has even inspired several remakes. In 1993, the show inspired a film of the same name, starring Harrison Ford as Dr. Richard Kimble. In the year 2000, there was also a short remake of the show, but it ended a year later. There is another remake of the same name which is set to be released in 2020, and while the plot has changed somewhat, the overall themes should remain the same. 

In today's video, we're going to look at some fascinating behind the scenes facts about The Fugitive. Even though its ratings dropped a little during its third and fourth season, its legendary series finale was so groundbreaking that a record number of audience members tuned in. Make sure you stick around, because we're going to reveal just how impactful that series finale truly was! We hope you like this video, and don't forget to subscribe to Facts Verse for more!

Welcome back, Richest fans! Recently, Facebook co-creator Mark Zuckerberg decided to add more property to his ever-expanding portfolio. This time, he purchased not one, but two homes in Lake Tahoe! Each one was worth millions of dollars! Today, we’re going to examine the homes he purchased and the amazing features of the lakeside properties. We’ll also see the residences of other Lake Tahoe homeowners and one in particular that might get film buffs excited. Finally, we’ll see the details and controversies of one of Zuckerberg’s most expensive houses, the Hawaii property. 
Now for the spoiler paragraph. If you like surprises, we suggest you stop reading and watch the video multiple times. Firstly, we’ll examine Lake Tahoe and the house that received a lot of publicity for it’s huge price, Crystal Pointe. We’ll then see how much money Zuckerberg funnelled from his huge net worth to become a resident in Lake Tahoe. We’ll see the features of his homes. Both Carousel Estate and Brushwood Estate. We then have a unique house for sale that was used in The Godfather: Part 2! We’ll see the Lake Tahoe property that was bought by Larry Ellison. It has ties to Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe! We’ll even see the home that belonged to famous recluse, Howard Hughes. Next stop is Hawaii with the eye-watering amount Zuckerberg spent on land. And we’ll see the consequence of the lawsuit when he sued the locals. Finally, we have a fun financial fact involving a pivotal Harry Potter house!

Read ProPublica reporter Ginger Thompson’s article here: https://www.propublica.org/article/ch...​

And listen to the full audio clip at ProPublica’s YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoncX...​ 

In April 2018, the Trump administration and Attorney General Jeff Sessions instituted a “zero tolerance” policy on undocumented immigration. Undocumented migrants and asylum seekers detained at the border now face immediate criminal prosecution, often before their asylum claims can even be processed. Thousands of children and other migrants are now being held in detention centers operated by US Customs and Border Protection, where they await trial.

A backlash against this policy is growing, with conservatives and liberals alike decrying it as cruel and inhumane. Both the White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Sessions have explicitly cited the policy as a preemptive deterrent to undocumented migration, though the administration has since backtracked on that message. 

We want to help shed light on this. Has your family been separated at the US–Mexico border? Are you a worker at a detention center, or do you aid families who have been affected? Tell us more at border@propublica.org or 347-244-2134.

Welcome back, Richest fans! With the end of his presidency, Donald Trump at least has massive net worth and his property portfolio to fall back on. And one of his most stunning residences is perhaps his least unknown. Trump actually has a Caribbean house worth millions of dollars! And it’s possible to rent it for a big fee. Today, we’re going to look at all the facts and figures of this estate on the island of Saint Martin. Then, we’re going to see which other famous faces have sprawling properties in the Caribbean and how much they’re worth. 
Now for the spoiler paragraph. If you like surprises, we suggest you stop reading and watch the video multiple times. Firstly, we’ll look at the island. We’ll see just how valuable land is there and how it compares to the rest of the world. We’ll then examine the extensive villas in detail. We’ll see how much all the features cost such as a tennis court and much more. Then, we have the celebs! We kick off with the frontman for the Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger, whose property was available for rent. We then have his bandmate, Keith Richards, and his hidden getaway. We’ll see just how much money Bruce Willis made when he sold his huge estate a couple of years ago. Then, we have Pirates of the Caribbean star, Johnny Depp, who has a whole island to himself! Finally, we finish off with Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison who purchased one of the most expensive private islands in the world!

Aphids can reproduce incredibly fast: they can make 20 new generations within a single season. And that means lots of poop. Some aphid populations can produce hundreds of kilograms of poop per acre— making them some of the most prolific poopers on the planet. We know this poop as the sweet, syrupy liquid called honeydew. George Zaidan explores the wonderfully weird life of an aphid.

Combine a genuine love for art history with a genuine interest in design and you have the hit formula that Ty Penington used to his advantage in the 2000s. During the early years of his career, with his handsome face and interesting personality, Ty had tried his hands at modelling and acting while continuing to work for clients in his Atlanta-based business called Furniture Unlimited.

In 2000, he got his big breakthrough in the form of TLC's Trading Spaces. However, in 2003, when ABC offered him Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, he quit Trading Spaces and joined Extreme Makeover as a team leader and host. The show won him two Primetime Emmy Awards and made him a household name.  

Back in the 2000s, Pennington was quite popular. However, after Extreme Makeover: Home Edition went off the air in 2012, Ty also quietly trickled into oblivion. Though the popular TV show host did a few shows here and there, after Extreme Makeover, none of the shows has been a great success. So, if you are wondering whatever happened to Ty Penington and why don't we see him now, hit the play button. We answer your questions in this video.

This year’s Consumer Electronics Show started to look a bit more like the Geneva Auto Show than it did an electronics show with companies like Lamborghini, Honda, and Hyundai revealing technology riddled concept cars that promise a future of flying taxis, supercars that can order toilet paper on the go, and self driving cars. Among those established car manufacturers and starry eyed start ups was a surprise entry, Sony with their Vision S sedan. As one would expect from a technology company like Sony, the Vision S is riddled with screens and interfaces that would allow drivers and passengers alike to access Sony Entertainment properties. But rather than show up with a flashy box that looks very much like a car that can really only at best be rolled on the showroom floor to show off their fancy technology, Sony showed up with a for real running driving electric car. Despite all that, Sony still is saying that they’re not getting in the car building car business any time soon. If that’s true, then why did Sony announce that the Vision S has showed up in Tokyo for testing, and what are they testing exactly? Well, it turns out that Sony has already sunk $5.3 billion into self driving sensor technology and the product of that investment is in part the Vision S. With the Vision S, Sony is hoping to be the bridge that turns self driving cars from science fiction into science reality and raking in the profits as the industry leader in self driving car technology. Let’s take a look at how that all shaped up.

If you thought that 2020 was already weird enough, it just got weirder. Found wandering through the dark, mysterious depths of our oceans, just off the west coast of Australia, scientists have recently discovered what is likely the largest creature to ever call our planet home. 

It spirals, it glows, and it looks like it was sent to us from another galaxy. That’s no joke.

What is this sinister sea-dweller? Who found it? And how afraid should we really be? Those answers to these questions, and a whole lot more, are about to be revealed.

YHTDFUAN3PZWKUST","Dig into the science of radiosurgery: a procedure that uses light beams of radiation to target tumors, without making a single incision.

--

Every year, tens of thousands of people have brain surgery without a single incision: there’s no scalpel, no operating table, and the patient loses no blood. Instead, this procedure uses a machine that emits invisible beams of light at a precise target inside the brain. So how exactly does this treatment work? And what does it do to the tumors it targets? Hyunsoo No explains radiosurgery.

Listen to the story on this episode of Today, Explained: https://spoti.fi/2GuKqLz​ 

When we think of the iconic moments of the Civil Rights Movement in the US, we might imagine bus boycotts, lunch counter sit-ins or the March on Washington. Most of us won’t think of protests at beaches and pools. Yet these battles in the country’s waters played a crucial role in transforming America. 

The campaign in the waters of St. Augustine, Florida, became one of the most critical in the movement to desegregate the US. The photos were published around the world, but the full story has often been left out of our history textbooks. And now, the legacy of segregated public waters continues to this day.

Note: The headline for this piece has been updated.

With a net worth of $420 million, Adam Sandler is one of the richest comedians in Hollywood. His movies have grossed hundreds of millions at the box office. Some of his biggest box office hits include Big Daddy, Grown Ups, and Click. Sandler’s transition from SNL cast member to movie star was seamless. He signed a lucrative film contract with Sony Pictures following the success of Big Daddy and made $60 million for his role in Anger Management. As his box office power began to decline, Sandler signed an impressive $250 million contract with Netflix. After producing 4 incredibly successful movies for Netflix, his contract was renewed for a further $250 million. Netflix renewed his contract again earlier this year for $275 million. Netflix paid Sandler $775 million total to produce and star in 12 movies for the streaming service. Sandler has spent his millions on luxurious mansions, beachfront properties, expensive cars, and flashy jewelry. Sandler paid $12 million for his stunning Pacific Palisades mansion, which was previously owned by Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Sandler and his wife attended a New Year’s Eve party hosted by Russell and Hawn in 2004, and Sandler’s wife was so impressed that she wanted to buy the house. A few years later, Sandler purchased the mansion next door. Adam Sandler’s real estate portfolio is worth $40 million. Following the success of Grown Ups, Sandler bought his co-stars limited edition Maseratis. Kevin James, Rob Schneider, Chris Rock, and David Spade all received sports cars worth $800,000. Keep watching to see how Sandler spends his millions.

Marion Robert Morrison, also known as Duke or John Wayne, was a Hollywood icon from the late 1930s till he passed away in 1979. The actor and filmmaker graced the screen in a whopping 179 productions over three decades of hits. Interestingly, his first leading role in The Big Trail tanked at the box office, and the roles that followed in the coming years on the big and small screen, such as in The Deceiver, The Three Musketeers, and Riders of Destiney, among others, did little for his career.

Wayne became a mainstream star with the box-office success of the 1939 American Western Stagecoach, which made him a household name across the country. After that, Wayne delivered many stellar performances, of which the most notable ones were in Sands of Iwo Jima, The Alamo, and True Grit. He received Oscar nominations for Best Actor for all three of the roles and bagged the Oscar for his portrayal of the U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn in the 1969 Western True Grit. The interesting fact is Wayne not only acted in the 1960 epic The Alamo, but he directed and produced it as well.

In the past 3,000 years, many populations have evolved genetic adaptations to their local environments. People in Siberia and the high arctic are uniquely adapted to survive extreme cold. The Bajau people can dive 70 meters and stay underwater for almost 15 minutes. So what are other recent changes? And will our technological innovations impact our evolution? Laurence Hurst investigates.

With support from Google, eight of them, ranging from a Google employee to a former White House staffer to a high schooler, shared their stories of addiction and recovery to help break the stigma and the silence associated with addiction and recovery.

This is Sharon's story. CEO of a healthcare-related company, her son got addicted to painkillers. He's now in recovery and she is using her firsthand experiences to help build a recovery-friendly workplace.

Recovery is possible, and stories like Sharon's should be celebrated and shared. Learn more about how Google is supporting the recovery movement at: g.co/recovertogether

Subscribe for more amazing videos! ► http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Richest​ ◄

 
Did giants used to roman the Earth? Do they still? With so many skeletons, mummies, and footprints found depicting much-larger than average humans, it just might be true that a species of giant human-like beings used to call the planet home. But with so many conspiracy theories out there, it’s hard to know what’s true and what’s fiction. 

There are many ancient accounts of giants, from the Pyramids of Egypt to burial grounds in New England. And across Asia ancient bones have been discovered depicting a large human ancestor that has long been extinct. There are even modern humans who experience a condition called gigantism. Could this explain how some ancient humans could be over 10 feet tall? 

From myths of the ancient Cyclops to accounts of modern giant attacks, here’s the proof we’ve dug up so far to help us answer an age-old question-- are giants real, or are they just a tall tale? 


For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com","The DJI Mini 2 is the best drone under $500. DJI’s first Mavic Mini drone was clearly made for people making their first step into the drone world. But its successor, the Mini 2 which now supports OcuSync and has an improved camera makes a very strong argument for even more experienced pilots and content creators.

Correction: A previous version of this video had the date January 7, 2019 at 0:11​ and sourced the Department of Western Australia at 0:24​. It has been corrected to January 7, 2020 and the Government of Western Australia. The current version also corrects an error at 2:10​ and 2:29​ where our voiceover mixed up East and West.

--
Australia’s recent fire season has been hellish with no end in sight. At least 17.9 million acres have burned, 28 people have died, and an estimated 1 billion animals have been lost. But while Australia burns, East Africa has been grappling with record-breaking rainfall leading to catastrophic floods. Both have a common cause — and it lies in the Indian Ocean.
